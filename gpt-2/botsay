The year is 20XX. Everyone plays Fox at TAS levels of perfection. Because of this, the winner of a match depends solely on port priority. The Rock Paper Scissors metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches. Humanity has reached its pinnacle. The low tier peasants are living in poverty. It seems nothing can stop the great leader of 20XX, Aziz “Hax” Al-Yami, and his army, the Fox monks who live in great monasteries where they levitate while TASing Fox with one hand, and winning tournaments with the other. The tournament metagame has gotten to this point where everything is played out to theoretical perfection, so tournament goers play Rock Paper Scissors for port priority, and that’s the game.
lets wait for output
This game seems so perfect that it has become the pinnacle of gaming in 20XX.

However, a small matter happens in the tournament meta, and you get a match against a lower tier peasant. But that match will only be played if you can win it in a random element. In other words, once again, there isn't any match played for port priority, and thus I will let it slide. To be honest, this game is really fun in a way because it offers so many different ways to play and defeat characters. To be honest, the game is so easy you can play it with everyone you know, and still get to have fun.

This meta is also a reflection of the fact that only the elites are given anything to play out in a tournament. In other words, it makes the rest of the players just want to play themselves out of these ridiculous situations to win some fancy, unique equipment.

In this Meta

The match-up is decided at random, and you play on the lowest priority match you can, usually TASing Fox with one hand to get port priority over TASing Fox and then TASing Fox with only one hand to do the same. If you TAS Fox on two consecutive times in a match, the same results and the same loser is the winner. The first set of Fox is chosen randomly so the first game takes place on Fox.
In order for Fox to win a match, there are two variables at play that have a big impact on the match:

The game: Fox has the highest port priority in this game, meaning a match will almost always be decided by a TAS if it costs less than this. This is important for your opponent to understand as he has to pay attention to this point. You can see this when your opponent does not notice your Fox is being TASed, then it's worth going for the TAS.

The match results: This is probably the most important stat in the entire game. Fox can win a tournament on Fox while TASing. When you win a Fox tournament, you will win another one and you will eventually win the tournament again (assuming the next tournament doesn't screw things up, which it will). It can also be broken down into its most common results depending on how much you spend, but the biggest effect of this is that your match success percentage comes down to how efficiently you perform a TAS (i.e., are you getting enough port priority in a match
