The oceans, seemingly limitless,
invoke in us a sense of awe and wonder
and also sometimes fear.

They cover 70% of the surface
of our planet,

and yet they are still
the least explored.

Hidden beneath the waves
right beneath my feet,

there are creatures
beyond our imagination.

With revolutionary technology,
we can enter new worlds...

...and shine a light on behaviours

in ways that were impossible
just a generation ago.

We've also recognised
an uncomfortable fact.

The health of our oceans
is under threat.

They're changing at a faster rate
than ever before in human history.

Never has there been a more crucial time

to reveal what is going on
beneath the surface of the seas.

In this first episode,

we will journey across the globe
from the warm waters of the tropics

to the coldest around the poles.

To bring us a new understanding
of live beneath the waves.

This is Blue Planet H.

The surface of the ocean conceals
the many creatures that live beneath

but not all.

Bottlenose dolphins.

They're extremely intelligent.

And with this intelligence
comes playfulness.

They surf.

And as far as we can tell,
they do so for the sheer joy of it.

But to properly appreciate
their true character,

you have to travel with them
into their world.

A pod of bottlenose dolphins is visiting
a coral reef in the Red Sea.

For the youngsters,
there are things to be learned here.

The adults lead a calf
to a particular bush-like coral

called a Gorgonian.

And here, the adults behave
rather strangely.

They deliberately rub themselves
through the fronds.

Their calf seems reluctant to do so.

By watching his elders,

he may be realising
that this is something he ought to do.

Gorgonia fronds, in fact,
are covered with a mucous

that can have anti-inflammatory
and antimicrobial properties.

So maybe the adult dolphins
are doing this

to protect themselves from infection.

The dolphins' intimate knowledge
of the reef

is spurring us to search
for new medicines here, too.

Tropical coral reefs

occupy only a tenth of one percent
of the ocean floor.

But their shallow warm waters
and stable year round conditions,

support some of the most crowded
and varied communities

to be found anywhere in the oceans.

And there are new discoveries to be made
on every one of them.

One creature
on Australia's Great Barrier Reef

is challenging our understanding
of fish intelligence.

A tusk fish.

And you can see why it gets its name.

He does something
few would have believed a fish could do.

Every morning,
he travels to the edge of the reef.

He's searching
for something special to eat

amongst the coral and sand.

Here's one.

A small clam.

But how to crack it open
and get to the meat?

He takes it all the way back

to his special kitchen.

A bowl-shaped coral

that has a particular bump on the inside
that he always uses.

It's not easy if you have no hands.

Whoops.

There he goes again.

But he's got great determination

and surprising accuracy.

At last.

So here is a fish that uses tools.

Some fish are much cleverer
than you might suppose.

The density of the animals
on tropical reefs

makes competition
inevitable and extreme.

Not only for those that lived
within the reef,

but for the birds that fly above them.

During the dry season,

over half a million terns

crowd onto this remote atoll
in the Indian Ocean.

Their chicks are still
in their dark, juvenile plumage.

They vary in age.

Whilst the more advanced chicks
take to the air,

others aren't quite ready yet.

Those just starting to learn to fly

use the shallow lagoon
that occupies the centre of the atoll

as their training ground.

It's difficult for some of them
to stay aloft for long.

Giant trevallies.

Usually, they're solitary hunters,

but about 50 of them have come here
from neighbouring reefs

attracted by this abundance
of potential prey.

The fledglings stay out of the water
if they can,

they even drink on the wing.

If the trevally are to catch one now,

they have to up their game.

So there is a fish here that amazingly

has a brain capable of calculating
the airspeed,

altitude and trajectory of a bird.

The time comes when every fledgling
has to take to the air

and collect food for itself.

Their parents lead them
to the training grounds.

If they're to survive,

they must learn quickly.

After a month of practising
over the lagoon,

the youngsters start to leave

and take their chances
out over the open sea.

The oceans hold 97% of all the water
in the world.

As the sun warms their surface,
water evaporates.

The vapour rises into the sky

until it cools and condenses
into towering clouds.

And they generate huge storms.

The spin of the earth
deflects these storms

north and south into cooler latitudes.

As they travel across the sea,

storm-driven winds create huge swells.

When the swells reach shallower waters,

they rise into gigantic waves.

In its lifetime,
a large storm can release energy

that is the equivalent
of 70, 000 nuclear bombs.

These are the seasonal seas.

And when they warm in spring,

they can suddenly explode with life.

Mobula rays have gathered
in Mexico's Sea of Cortez

in vast numbers.

Why do they leap?

Is it to tell others that they're here?

No one knows.

They feed mostly at night

for that is when vast swarms
of plankton rise from the depths.

The disturbance in the water stimulates
many of the planktonic creatures

to luminesce.

Only now do we have the technology
to record their faint glow.

The feasting rays swim through them

creating an extraordinary ballet
of life and death.

The richness of these waters
is based on microscopic plants,

Phytoplankton,

which bloom on such a massive scale
they benefit us all.

They, together with seaweeds
and sea grasses,

produce as much oxygen

as all the forests
and grassy plains on land.

Every spring off New Zealand,

the seasonal bounty
draws in rare visitors.

False killer whales.

They're relatives of the orca,

six metres long
and weighing over a tonne.

They appear to be searching
for dolphins.

And there are many
in these coastal waters.

Here, bottlenose dolphins stick together

constantly chattering
with whistles and clicks.

Such a din carries for miles underwater.

The false killers have detected them.

Travelling at ten knots,
the killers quickly close in on them.

But then,
something truly extraordinary happens.

The dolphins turn

as if to greet their pursuers.

They seem to change their course.

Could it be that they're attempting
to communicate?

Scientists studying
this annual encounter,

now think that individuals
may recognise one another.

Almost unbelievably,
it seems that these different species

appear to be old friends.

Together they're gathering
as one unified army

up to a thousand strong.

This formidable hunting party
now harvests the riches

that come with New Zealand's summer.

All across the higher latitudes,

seasonal seas flourish
under the summer sun.

Here in Alaska,
sea otters lounge in the canopy

of great submarine forests.

Giant kelp, the biggest seaweed of all
is home to all kinds of life.

On the forest floor, spiny
sea urchins munch through the kelp.

Elsewhere there are continuously hungry
sea cucumbers

And in the tangled undergrowth,

wonderfully camouflaged sea dragons.

In the underwater forests
of northern Japan,

the residents of this sunken wreck

are waiting for the summer temperatures
to reach 16 degrees Celsius.

That for some is the time for mating.

A kind of giant wrasse called a Kobudai.

This is a male.

And in female terms,
he's particularly handsome.

He's a metre long and weighs 15 kilos.

Much larger than the diminutive female,

and he is ready to breed.

He attempts to mate with her

and with any of the dozen or so females
that live in his territory,

whenever he gets the chance.

But females from around ten years old

take little notice of his advances.

This is because when any large female
reaches a critical body size,

she can begin a dramatic transformation.

Over just a few months,

particular enzymes inside her body
cease to work,

and male hormones start to circulate.

As time passes,

her head expands

and her chin gets longer.

A she has changed into a he.

And with this comes a change
in temperament.

The old male who rules
all the females here

is challenged to a face off.

The more bulbous the head,

the more it intimidates an opponent.

The territory has a new ruler.

Only the largest females transform
themselves in this way.

But the change enables them
to have more mates,

so they will have many more offspring
carrying their genes.

But a new male can't afford
to be complacent.

Inside the body of every Kobudai female,

there is a new male in waiting.

The closer we travel towards the poles,
the colder the seas become.

Icebergs appear.

Huge slabs that have broken away

from glaciers that are sliding
into the sea.

And then the surface starts to freeze.

While the lights of the aurora
play above,

even in the depths of midwinter,

there are a few places
well north of the Arctic circle

that are still open.

The fjords of northern Norway
remain ice free

because a giant current,
the Gulf Stream,

flows up here from the south

bringing warmth all the way
from the Caribbean.

And every winter,

billions of herring
come here for shelter.

And following them...

...Orca.

There are up to a thousand of them.

It's possibly the greatest gathering
of orca on the planet.

The herring maybe plentiful
but in these winding fjords

they're not always easy to track down.

These particular orca, however,

are fish hunting specialists.

They work as a team,

coordinating their approach
by calling loudly to one another.

They herd the herring
into tighter and tighter shoals.

They swim below them,

trapping them against
the surface of the sea.

And now the orca deploy
their special weapon.

They beat their tails with such force,

that the shock waves stun the herring.

And then the senseless victims
are easily collected.

But all this underwater noise
attracts others.

Humpback whales.

They move in on the action.

They approach the shoal from beneath
and then lunge upwards,

gathering up to a hundred kilos
of herring in a single mouthful.

The humpbacks are comparative newcomers.

They only started coming here
within the last decade.

But these polars seas are so rich

that there appears to be enough food
for everyone.

Nonetheless, few if any of these riches

would be here were it not
for the Gulf Stream.

Ocean currents, in fact, are crucial
to the well being of our planet.

They distribute the sun's heat
towards the poles

all the way from the equator,

maintaining a climate favourable
for life almost everywhere.

From creating the weather
to producing oxygen,

the seas keep our world healthy.

But there are now worrying signs

that conditions in the oceans

that have remained relatively stable
for millennia

are changing radically.

Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Arctic.

Here in the past 30 years,

the extent of the ice in summer
has been reduced by 40%.

This sudden warming,

most likely a consequence
of human activity,

is having a profound impact
on its wildlife.

Walruses are among those
that are seriously affected.

Every adult female
needs to find a safe place

where her 80-kilo pup can rest.

The sea ice is retreating

from much
of the walrus' traditional range,

so they now have
to haul out on dry land.

But a herd of hundreds
of quarrelsome mothers,

some weighing almost a tonne,
is not an ideal nursery.

Walruses on land stick together
for good reason.

Polar bears.

A full grown male walrus is gigantic,

too big for even a polar bear to tackle.

So the bear is looking
for a walrus baby.

The scent of the bear
spreads alarm through the colony.

The walruses retreat into the sea.

The bear knows it won't be able
to catch them there.

But she too has young ones to feed.

What is a mother to do?

A mother walrus still needs
to find a place

where her young can rest.

A melting iceberg might do,

but she is not the first
to find this one.

Suitable places are already taken.

Other mothers don't want to share.

They, too, need a patch of ice
where they can protect their young.

A desperate mother has no choice
but to barge her way in.

So this time everyone loses.

Finding the right place
on these melting shores

gets harder and harder.

Solving these problems together
helps create a bond so strong

that the mother will stay in contact
with her young for the rest of her life.

But who knows now
what their future will be.

As we understand more
about the complexity

of the lives of sea creatures,

so we begin to appreciate
the fragility of their home.

Our blue planet.

Next time.

The deep.

A world richer
than we ever though possible,

where creatures thrive,

in the most extreme conditions on Earth.

Antarctica.

The coldest, the harshest,
and the most remote continent on Earth.

No human being has ever descended
into the depths that surround it...

...until now.

The deep ocean is as
challenging to explore as space.

We know more about the surface of Mars

than we do about
the deepest parts of our seas.

Now we can dive
these uncharted depths,

to discover what secrets lie beneath.

Sinking down beside
the submerged wall of an iceberg,

we enter an unforgiving world.

These waters
are the coldest on Earth.

As we descend into the deep,

the pressure increases relentlessly.

And the light from above
all but disappears.

Yet, incredibly...

there is life here.

We might have expected

that deep beneath
the surface of the Polar seas,

the waters would be truly barren.

But, in fact, we find life here
in unimaginable abundance.

Nor is such great abundance
confined to Antarctic waters.

Currents carry this richness

into the depths of almost
every ocean around the world.

Astonishingly, in the deep sea,

there is more life
than anywhere else on Earth.

The sunlight fades,

and the seas darken.

Here, in the Pacific, 200 metres down,

we enter an alien world.

The Twilight Zone,

a sea of eternal gloom.

There are strange creatures here.

A pyrosome.

A tube of jelly two metres long
that dwarfs a visitor from above,

an oceanic whitetip shark.

Only a tiny amount of light
filters down this far.

Survival here means making the most
of every last glimmer.

A swordfish.

Its eyes are as big as tennis balls
to help it see in the perpetual dusk.

A squid, but this is one
that lives only here.

Its right eye
looks permanently downwards.

But its left eye is much bigger
and trained upwards

to detect the silhouettes of prey
swimming nearer the surface.

No wonder it's nicknamed
the "cock-eyed squid".

And even stranger,

this is barreleye,

a fish with a transparent head,

filled with jelly,

so that it can look up
through its skull.

We now know that
the Twilight Zone is a refuge

for an incredible 90%
of all fish in the ocean.

Only at night,
do vast shoals of lanternfish

migrate to the surface
to feed on tiny plankton.

By day, they retreat back down here.

Humboldt squid.

Two metres long
and 50 kilos in weight.

Like most squid,
they're voracious hunters.

There are hundreds of them.

They found a shoal of lanternfish

hiding 800 metres down,
off the coast of South America.

Their tentacles are armed
with powerful suckers

with which they grab their prey.

And when there are
no more lanternfish to be found,

they turn on each other.

This squid has caught
a smaller one in its tentacles.

To hide its capture from the rest,

it releases a smokescreen of black ink.

But then, an even
bigger one challenges it

and steals its catch.

The Twilight Zone

is the Humboldt squid's
favourite hunting ground.

They seldom go deeper

into the world
of perpetual blackness below.

The Midnight Zone.

Two-thirds of
a mile from the surface,

beyond the reach of the sun.

A giant black void

larger than all the rest
of the world's habitat's combined.

There's life here,

but not as we know it.

Alien-like creatures

produce dazzling displays of light.

Nearly all animals
need to attract mates

and repel predators.

This language of light
is so widespread here,

that these signals are probably
the commonest form of communication

on the entire planet.

And yet,
we still know little about them.

Hunters illuminate themselves,

and by doing so

attract inquisitive prey.

This is fangtooth.

It has the largest teeth
for its size of any fish.

There are pressure sensors
all over its head and body

which can detect anything
moving in the surrounding water.

It's the Midnight Zone's
most voracious fish.

But prey use light as a distraction.

A decoy of luminous ink.

Down here, in this blackness,

creatures live beyond
the normal rules of time.

Siphonophores are virtually eternal.

They repeatedly clone themselves,

some eventually growing
longer than a blue whale.

Down here, it snows.

Continuous clouds of organic debris

drift slowly down from above.

This is food,

and a whole variety
of filter feeders depend on it.

Jellyfish.

And delicate sea cucumbers.

The 1% of marine snow they miss

eventually settles on the sea floor.

Over millions of years,

it forms a layer of mud
up to a mile thick.

It's an empty plain

that covers half
the surface of our planet.

The deep seabed may,
at first, appear lifeless,

but it's home to a unique
cast of mud dwellers.

The sea toad.

It is an ambush predator
with an enormous mouth

and infinite patience.

This fish has been
living for so long here

that its fins have changed
into something more useful.

Feet.

They help it shuffle about
on the sea floor.

The flapjack octopus.

It hovers just above
the surface of the mud

as it delicately sifts through it
searching for worms.

But it can jet away
at the first sign of danger.

A sixgill shark,
as big as a great white.

It may not have eaten
for an entire year.

It patrols the mud plains

using a minimum amount of energy.

High above,

the carcass of a huge sperm whale

is slowly decaying.

This will be a bonanza
for the creatures of the deep.

Food.

Thirty tonnes of it.

Finally it settles on the ocean floor

and its presence is soon detected.

Sixgills sharks

have an exceptionally
acute sense of smell.

just 25 minutes
after the whale's carcass arrives,

a sixgill finds it.

Each bite releases
blood into the current.

The news that food
is here spreads quickly.

Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.

Within 12 hours,
there are seven enormous sharks

jostling with one another

as they compete to tear off mouthfuls.

No one is prepared to back off.

Twenty-four hours later,

and a third of the carcass has gone.

The first arrival has gorged

until it's completely full.

This single meal

may be enough to sustain it
for a whole year.

Now, the clean up team arrives.

Spider crabs carrying coral
in their hind legs,

presumably as makeshift body armour.

There are rock crabs here too.

They probably detected the carcass
almost as soon as the sharks,

but they can't move as fast.

A month on,
and over 30 species of scavenger

are clearing away
the last edible fragments.

But now, the scavengers
are attracting their own predators.

Scabbardfish, habitually
swimming upright,

are picking them off one by one.

Some of the whale's teeth
have been dislodged

as the skeleton starts to fall apart.

Four months later,
there is nothing left but a few bones.

But even they are food

for something.

Zombie worms.

They tunnel into the bones
by injecting acid

and so reach the tiny amounts of fat
that still remain there.

It may take decades,

but eventually,
the last of the bones will crumble,

and the whole 50-tonne carcass
will have been recycled.

A whale fall is a temporary oasis

in the desert of the sea floor.

But there are permanent oases here too.

Rocks projecting above the mud

provide anchorage for deep sea corals.

As far down
as three and a half miles,

there are more species of coral
in the deep

than on shallow tropical reefs.

Without sunlight,
they rely solely on food

drifting in the current.

And they grow

just a hair's breadth a year.

But some of them
can live for 4,000 years.

They, like their
shallow water relatives,

provide homes for all kinds
of other creatures.

Growing among the corals,

is one of the most beautiful of sponges.

This is Venus' flower basket.

These sponges have lodgers.

Shrimps.

There are plenty
of predators on the reef

so the shrimps are fortunate.

Both this male and female,

were swept into this sponge
when they were tiny larvae,

along with the minute particles of food

on which the sponge feeds.

They found each other
and have been here ever since.

Now, they're full-grown

and the female is carrying eggs.

Once hatched, the larvae will swim
out through the sponge's walls.

But the shrimps will never leave.

They can't.

They're now far too big
to go out the way they came in.

And, no doubt,
they will live longer here

than they would if they were
wandering about on the reef unprotected.

But how one
of the simplest of all animals,

a sponge, is able to build
such a complex structure

to the great benefit of the shrimps

is a mystery.

And, surely, a marvel.

But today,

their timeless world
is being reduced to rubble.

As over-fishing empties
the surface waters of the seas,

trawlers have started
to ransack the deep.

Now, countless numbers of the reefs

that have flourished here for millennia

lie in ruins.

Over time,

organic matter on the sea floor
slowly decays

producing methane.

In the Gulf of Mexico,

these eruptions also release
a super salty liquid.

Brine.

Five times heavier than sea water,

it accumulates in great pools
on the sea floor.

It's difficult to make sense
of the sight.

A lake of concentrated salt water,

fifteen metres deep,

at the bottom of the sea.

Around its margin,
perhaps even more strangely,

there is a profusion of life.

Giant mussels that can live
or grow for a century or more,

pack tightly together,

dwarfing the shrimps and squat lobsters
that feed around them.

Cutthroat eels, scavengers,

come to the shores of the brine lake

in search of something edible.

Some even venture into the brine.

Spending too long in it
can send an eel into toxic shock.

It' only hope
is to rise above it.

It manages to escape.

Others are not so lucky.

The brine embalms their bodies,

and the casualties of decades
accumulate around the margins.

But parts of the deep
are even more hostile.

In places,

gigantic cracks stretch for many miles
across the ocean floor.

Canyons that plunge
towards the centre of the earth.

Scans from survey vessels

make it possible to graphically
reconstruct an image

of this vast submarine landscape.

The deepest of all,
at almost seven miles,

is the Mariana Trench
in the Pacific Ocean.

Even Mount Everest
could disappear inside it.

Down here, in these deep ravines,

it was once thought that
nothing whatever could possibly survive.

But there is life even here.

A kind of sea slug.

A so-called sea pig.

They, and other simple creatures,

manage to survive on the minuscule
amount of food that drifts down here.

Like this starfish,

they can withstand pressure
equivalent of 50 jumbo jets

stacked on top of one another.

A remote camera probe

reveals the most
extraordinary discovery of all.

The ethereal snailfish.

At five miles down,

this is the deepest living fish
so far discovered.

No one imagined

than an animal as complex as a fish

could exist in such extreme pressures.

From the greatest depths

to the uppermost limit
of the Twilight Zone,

it seems that there is
nowhere in the deep sea

where life of some kind can't survive.

And we now think

that the deep sea may well be
where life on Earth began.

Here,

in a world hidden within the greatest
geological feature on Earth,

running right down the middle
of the world's oceans,

an underwater mountain range

spanning the entire globe.

The mid-ocean ridge.

In the South Pacific,

the ocean floor is being torn apart.

Over three quarters
of the planet's volcanic activity

occurs in the deep.

Almost all of it along
the mid-ocean ridge.

But from this titanic violence

come great riches.

Gases and scalding water
gush up through the crevices.

Minerals condensing from these jets

build up great chimneys.

Hydrothermal vents.

This one, 30 metres tall,

has been named "Godzilla

Astonishingly, we now know

that they hold as much life
as tropical rainforests.

In places, half a million
individual animals

are crammed into a single square metre.

They depend entirely
for their food on bacteria.

And they feed on chemicals

dissolved in the searingly hot fluid.

Crabs consume the bacterial mats

that coat their shells.

Others maintain
bacterial cultures,

actually within their bodies.

Shrimps carry such cultures
in their mouth parts.

But that is a strategy
fraught with danger.

To provide sustenance
for these microbes,

the shrimps must dash
into the hot vents,

and that risks being boiled alive.

In the last decade,

the number of hydrothermal vents
discovered has doubled.

Every one has its own unique
character and community.

But, perhaps, the most important
one of all is in the Atlantic.

It has been named "The Lost City".

Within its 60-metre towers,

something truly extraordinary
is taking place.

Under extremes
of pressure and temperature,

hydrocarbons,

the molecules that are the basic
component of all living things,

are being created spontaneously.

Indeed, many scientists now believe

that life on Earth
may have begun around a vent like this

four billion years ago.

We now know
that there are deep seas

on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

If life can exist under
such extreme conditions down here,

then surely it could exist
somewhere out there.

Next time, we travel
to bustling coral reefs.

Here, animals must go
to extraordinary lengths

to get ahead of the competition
in these crowded cities.


In a far corner
of S oath-East Asia,

lies the Coral Triangle.

A cluster of the richest coral reefs,
in the world.

Undersea cities crammed full of life.

As in any crowded metropolis,

there is fierce rivalry for space,

for food

and for a partner.

But the reef is also a place
full of opportunity.

A cuttlefish.

It specialises in hunting crabs.

But a large crab is a dangerous quarry.

It has powerful claws.

The cuttlefish, however,
has a remarkable talent.

Its skin contains millions
of pigment cells

with which it can create
ever-changing colours

and patterns.

And that apparently hypnotises the crab.

A cuttlefish may be clever,

but a shark is bigger.

And it eats cuttlefish.

Time to disappear.

Back to the hunt.

A new target,
but the same mesmerising technique.

For those that manage to establish
themselves in these bustling

undersea cities,

there can be great rewards.

Corals build themselves
homes of limestone,

in the warm, clear,
shallow seas of the Tropics.

Their reefs occupy less than one tenth

of one percent of the ocean floor.

Yet, they're home to a quarter

of all known marine species.

They are complex,

infinitely variant structures,

providing all kinds of homes
for their many residents,

from penthouse suites,

to backstreet dens.

Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,

a coral grouper lives
by hunting for small fish.

But how do you get a meal here,

when you're too big
to squeeze into crevices?

And the grouper also has a rival,

one which is highly intelligent,

and seeks the same kind of prey.

An octopus.

It can reach into really narrow cracks.

Even so,

its prey often escapes.

What if they could work together?

The grouper turns pale,

and tries to attract
the octopus's attention.

It performs a head stand.

Not only is the grouper signalling
to the octopus,

it's indicating
where the prey is hiding.

The octopus reaches inside.

The fish take fright.

And swim straight into
the grouper's jaws.

Sometimes, the octopus gets the reward,

sometimes, the grouper does.

Two very different species

have discovered
that teamwork can bring success,

in reef city.

Teamwork, in fact,
is the very foundation of life

on the reef.

The corals themselves
also rely on a partnership.

But one of a much more intimate kind.

Corals are colonies
of anemone-like animals,

polyps.

Some as small as grains of sand.

Living inside the tissues of each polyp,

are minute plant-like cells,
invisible to the naked eye.

By day flourishing in tropical sunshine,

the plant-like cells provide the polyps

with up to 90% of their food.

And when it's dark,
the polyps continue to feed

by using their tentacles to grab
edible particles drifting by.

The polyps also extract
calcium carbonate from the sea water,

and use it to build a stony housing
for themselves.

Coral colonies
can continue to grow for centuries.

Possibly millennia.

And they can build structures
that can reach the size of a house.

The biggest of their cities,
is the Great Barrier Reef.

It runs for over 7400 miles
along the coast of North East Australia.

Activity in coral reefs,
wherever they are, never ceases.

At dawn, the day shift begins.

Accompanied by a chorus
of submarine song,

created by fish, shrimps,
and other inhabitants of the reef.

Every resident in this city,
has its role.

Scavengers, like the sea cucumber,

recycle the waste of others.

These parrot fish,
bite off chunks of coral

and crunch it
to extract the contents.

And then, excrete the rest as sand.

Green turtles, here in Borneo,

pay regular visits
to a particular patch of coral.

This little female is up early
and one step ahead of the others.

Turtles travel long distances along
the reef in order to get here.

This is their destination.

Turtle Rock.

Generations of visiting turtles
have worn a hollow in its top.

This is home to blennies

and surgeon fish.

They clean the visitors picking off
any algae, parasites and dead skin,

that they can find.

Other client are close behind.

A queue is forming.

The big males barge their way in.

And the smaller female is forced out.

She takes a quick turn around the block,

while the others are squabbling.

And then, she sneaks back in.

So the cleaners get a nutritious meal,

and their customers are freed of
their parasites and other encumbrances.

And it's now thought, that a spot
of pampering at a cleaning station

may even reduce stress.

The lands of the Middle East
are so hot and dry,

that much of their surface
is almost lifeless.

But here in the Red Sea,

Coral Reefs flourish wonderfully.

The waters offshore,

are almost as rich
in life as a rainforest.

And some animals come to the reefs

simply for rest and relaxation.

The family of bottlenose dolphins

are resting on the reef

after a night's feeding offshore.

Whilst the adult and their babies sleep,

the adolescents set of the explore...

...and they appear to make up games.

You might call this one,
"Catch the coral."

The rules aren't entirely clear.

They pick up different bits
of broken coral,

and drop them.

Some fall fast.

Others sink more slowly.

And some seem to be descending in a way

that pleases everybody.

Only the most successful city residents
can afford the luxury of playing games.

But, such games do that their value.

They may help the youngsters develop
the coordination and the agility

that they will need when
they start hunting in the open sea.

Every reef
has a sharply defined boundary.

Its city walls.

On the outer side is the drop off.

These ramparts protect the city
from the ocean waves.

But twice a day, the walls are covered
by the incoming tide.

In the Bahamas, the rush of the water
creates a truly strange phenomenon.

Seamen once told tales
of a giant sea monster,

lurking here deep inside the reef,

that would drag sailors to their doom.

Today, we know it is in fact a whirlpool
created by the incoming tide

rushing over deep coral caves.

These currents bring in fresh supplies
of microscopic food to the reef

from the open ocean.

And in the Maldives,
on the biggest tides,

one particular coral lagoon

become so flooded with plankton,

that it attracts hundreds
of ocean giants.

Manta Rays.

With three-metre wing spans.

With their huge sloth
like mouths wide open

they filter out the plankton.

And the mantas create
a vortex of their own

that further concentrates their food.

This behaviour has been called
the manta cyclone.

Then the tide changes,

and the supply of food is cut of.

The mantas leave the lagoon.

Life on the sheltered side of the reef
is tranquil and peaceful.

In these suburbs,
any creature wishing to escape

from the bustling crowds of reef city,

can find plenty of space.

On the other hand,

there is nowhere to hide.

That, at night,

makes it a dangerous place.

Nocturnal predators,
such as this lion fish,

patrol the reef edge.

The hunter has become the hunted.

A hobbit,

a giant carnivorous worm

with jaws as sharp as daggers.

It has an ancestry that stretches back
more than four hundred million years.

It's a metre long.

It tastes for scent.

And feels for movement.

Dawn, and with light,
the reef becomes a safer place.

Little bream return to foraging.

The bobbit might still be hungry.

But now in daylight
the odds have shifted.

The bream can see the bobbit.

Instead of retreating,

they join together to blow away
the sand covering the worm.

So, taking away
its advantage of surprise.

By revealing the [rabbit's hiding place,

they will all be able
to feed more safely.

But it pays to remember

there is a bobbit about.

Out here, on the sand flats,

there is safe accommodation for some.

The family of saddleback clownfish
have found an excellent home.

The tentacles
of this carpet anemone can kill.

But the clownfish
are immune to the poison,

so they can shelter from danger.

In return, the fish keep the anemone
clean of debris.

As with all clownfish,

the family is ruled by a big female.

Her white face marks her out
as the boss.

The diminutive male
has to prove his worth,

so he works tirelessly,

removing debris and generally keeping
on top of the housework.

His greatest challenge
is to find a safe place

where the boss can lay her eggs.

But there's nothing solid here
for the female to lay them on.

A nearby shell could be the solution.

If only he can move it
to the protection of the anemone.

Too heavy.

Besides, it has a mind of its own.

The hermit crab.

But out here, twice a day,

the anemone is swept by tidal currents,

and they bring in new opportunities.

An old plastic bottle.

Perhaps, this will do.

Not heavy enough.

A coconut shell.

It looks just right.

But it's a long way from home.

And he can't move it by himself.

So the pair now work together.

A little adjustment
to the anemone's tentacles,

in order to clear a space for it.

And the shell is tucked in.

The female lays.

A safe nursery at last.

He has proved himself worthy
to father her young.

And he fertilizes them.

Now he will meticulously tend the eggs,

keeping them clean
and healthy until they hatch

in 10 days time.

Reef creatures go to great lengths to
give their young a head start in life.

And nowhere more so

than on the remotest reefs in the world.

French Polynesia,

the very heart of the South Pacific.

Protected by their isolation,

some of the reefs here,
are still virtually pristine.

This marbled grouper has made it
in the city and reached adulthood.

Now, it's the time to mate.

To find a partner, he must head
to the most dangerous part of this reef:

The drop off.

Patrolled by grey reef sharks,

hundreds of them.

They seem to be resting,

for now.

Thousands of other groupers
have gathered on the seabed below.

The females are almost bursting
with eggs.

But to mate with one,

he must first get through the crowd
of other waiting males.

And they all have the same thing
on their minds.

They jostle to get as close as possible
to a female.

This male may have
secured pole position,

but the female won't release
her eggs for him to fertilize,

until conditions are just right.

Now the sharks begin to close in,

sensing that
the critical moment is approaching.

The tide is beginning to turn.

This could be the moment to spawn.

Suddenly, the females rush up
towards the surface

releasing their clouds
of eggs as they go.

The males pursue them,
simultaneously releasing their sperm.

It's an act
the groupers seem prepared to die for.

It's now or never.

The fertilized eggs,

will now be swept away

from the many hungry mouths
of the reef dwellers.

Most of the billions of eggs
that cloud the sea,

will be eaten.

But a few,

a tiny but crucial minority,

will find another reef

and make it their home.

But today's coral reefs
are facing a new threat.

The seas are warming.

A rise in temperature
of just one for two degrees

for just a few weeks,

can be enough to cause the coral polyps
to eject their plant-like cells.

When that happens,
the corals lose both their colour,

and their main source of food.

If the high temperatures are sustained,

coral, bleached in this way,

is likely to die.

In recent years, it's thought that
half the world's coral reefs

have been affected by bleaching.

Including, since 2016,

around two thirds
of the shallow water corals,

on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

These once crowded submarine cities,

are reduced

to bleak ruins.

and many of their inhabitants,
left homeless.

Some scientists predict
that by the end of the century,

coral reef cities as we know them,

could be a thing of the past.

Is there any future for these most
precious of ocean treasures?

Well, that ultimately depends
on how fast they heat up,

and how warm the seas become.

And there is a glimmer of hope,

because of the way
the corals reproduce themselves.

On one special night of the year,

the full moon triggers
an extraordinary event:

The spawning of the coral.

With extraordinary synchrony,
entire reefs reproduce.

Billions of fertilized eggs drift away

carried by the ocean currents.

And it's not just the corals that spawn,

so do many other residents of the reef.

A whole range of young

are swept through the oceans,

ready to settle on a vacant site,

and bring back into existence
the complex community,

that is a coral reef.

We may not know what the future
hold for our seas,

but coral reefs can regenerate.

As long as some reefs survive,

some hope can remain.

Next time, we head
into the vastness of the open ocean.

To survive in this blue wilderness,
some are fast,

others use deadly strategies,

and a few rely on the closeness
of their families.


The world's greatest wilderness,

the open ocean.

It covers over half
the surface of our planet.

Here, there is nowhere to hide

and little to eat.

It's the marine
equivalent of a desert.

And patrolling this desert,
spinner dolphins.

They stick together.

In a super pod, 5,000-strong.

That maximises their chances
of finding something to eat.

Like all who live here,

they must go to extraordinary lengths

to make their home in the big blue.

There are rare moments

when these empty seas
can explode with life.

Lanternfish off the Pacific Coast
of Costa Rica.

They're scarcely bigger than minnows.

But what they lack in size,

they make up for in numbers.

They are one of the most
numerous fish anywhere.

Normally they only come
to the surface at night

to feed on plankton.

But this immense shoal
has risen during the day,

almost certainly in order to spawn.

For the dolphins,
this would be a bonanza.

They have located the shoal
using their echo-sounding calls.

But they
have to get to it quickly.

They are not the only hunters here.

Yellowfin tuna have also
detected the shoal.

And behind them,
with their two-metre wingspans,

Mobula rays.

Now sailfish,

one of the fastest fish in the sea,
have joined the chase.

The lanternfish may return
to the deep at any moment.

But now, the dolphins have got here.

They swim beneath the shoal,
pinning it to the surface

and forcing the lanternfish
to pack more closely together.

And now the sea begins to boil.

The tuna charge into
the shoal at over 40 miles an hour.

The slower swimming rays arrive at last.

With their immense mouths agape,

they scoop up the lanternfish
by the hundred.

The shoal has now
been largely dispersed,

and the sailfish pick off the survivors.

In just 15 minutes,

all that's left
is a silvery confetti of scales.

But here, such feasts
are only too infrequent.

Whilst the dolphins perform
great feats of endurance,

others are driven
to even greater extremes

to find food in this ocean desert.

A sleeping giant.

A sperm whale.

This family is resting
between bouts of feeding.

Who knows what the owners

of the biggest brain
in the planet dream about.

One has a calf.

It's about two weeks old, but still
dependent on its mother's milk.

It's hungry.

It communicates with
its mother using a pattern of clicks.

But its mother slumbers on.

The calf,
covered in suckerfish,

of which it can't yet rid itself,

has to be patient.

Sleep over, and refreshed,

the whales move on.

Sperm whales don't wait for their prey
to rise to the surface.

They swim down
into the depths to find it.

They take a series of heavy breaths...

...to saturate their blood with oxygen.

Then, down they go.

This entire family
dives together in search of squid.

The mother will push her body
to the limits of her endurance,

and already it's hard for her calf
to keep up with her.

The calf sticks to its mother
as closely as it can

touching her frequently

as if for reassurance.

But 500 metres down,

it seems the calf
can't hold its breath any longer.

In their early years,
calves are forced to sit out the hunt.

The adults continue their dive.

The mother changes her calls

into a series of louder
and more rapid clicks.

She's now using sonar
to hunt down shoals of squid.

At 800 metres, a burst of clicks.

Then, silence.

She's made a catch.

The hunters could be away
for as much as an hour.

Finally, the mother
returns from the deep

with a stomach full of squid.

After a long wait,

this hungry calf can take some milk.

It's one of the richest
produced by any mammal.

And the calf guzzles
a bathful of it a day.

It may be six years before a calf
masters the art of deep diving

and is able to find food for itself.

The emptiness of the big blue
is what makes life so hard for hunters.

But it's this emptiness

that makes it
comparatively safe for prey.

A baby turtle, hatched just days ago,

is leaving the crowded,
dangerous waters of the coast,

and heading for the open ocean.

Only recently have we
begun to solve the mystery

of where baby turtles disappear to
in their early years.

To start with, they fill
their little stomachs with plankton.

But soon, they need
something more substantial.

Hundreds of miles offshore,
in every ocean,

there are communities
of young castaways.

So, anything
that floats attracts them.

A Ivy-

It may have been
at sea for several years,

and it has already become
the centre of a small community.

Young pufferfish are here
for the same reason.

A floating log
is just the kind of refuge

this young turtle has been looking for.

Here, there's not only seaweed
on which to graze,

but barnacles.

But it's important to stay undercover.

A young ocean-going
silky shark is here too.

It's learning what tastes good,

and what doesn't.

We now know
that many young turtles

stay in such places for several years

until adulthood.

Even if it means facing
the full force of the high seas.

The sun, beating down
on the deep blue,

warms the surface waters
so that they evaporate.

As the vapour rises,
it condenses into clouds.

They rapidly build into
gigantic burgeoning towers,

which eventually
generate violent storms,

some a thousand miles across.

Hurricane force winds
sweep across the open ocean,

building waves
that could rise to 30 metres tall.

Out here, ships have been
known to sink without trace.

One hundred
and thirty million containers

are shipped across
the oceans every year.

And on average, four of them
fall into the sea every day.

In 1992,

a few were lost that contained
a consignment of bath toys,

including 7,000
plastic ducks like these.

They started their travels
a thousand miles off Alaska.

Some drifted
right across the Pacific Ocean,

and reached Australia.

Others were carried north,

and landed on shores
between Russia and Alaska.

They even found their way
into the high Arctic.

One duck,
having been at sea for 15 years,

and crossing three oceans,

eventually landed
on the west coast of Scotland.

Their travels vividly illustrate

how a network of currents
connects all our oceans

into one gigantic circulatory system.

Many of the inhabitants of the big blue

rely on these currents
to carry them to feeding grounds.

The blue shark.

It travels over 5,000 miles a year,

riding on the currents,

supported by its broad wing-shaped fins.

This one may not
have eaten for two months.

But the currents can carry
promising traces of fatty oils

from many miles away

and will lead it to its next meal.

After days of travel,
the smell of food gets stronger.

A dead whale,
recently struck by a ship.

This could be a real feast,

but the blue shark must be cautious.

Great white sharks,

ten times heavier than the blue,

are highly possessive
around a whale carcass.

Great whites are eager
to feed on energy-rich whale blubber,

which we now know
forms a major part of their diet.

Once the great white has had its fill,

smaller sharks, like the blue shark,

tackle what's left of the carcass.

As the oils from this dead whale
spread more widely,

more and more blue sharks appear.

Within days, the carcass
will be stripped of its blubber.

Then, no longer kept buoyant by its oil,

it will sink into the depths below.

The blue, with its reserves
of fat replenished,

can now survive
for another two months without eating.

Over half of all animals
in the open ocean

drift in currents.

jellyfish cross entire oceans

feeding on whatever happens
to tangle with their tentacles.

Some can grow to a metre,
even two metres across.

And when, by lucky chance,

they encounter
a patch of sea rich in plankton,

their numbers explode.

It's such a successful strategy,

that jellies are one of the most
common lifeforms on the planet.

But among the jellies,

and looking somewhat like them,

is a rather more complex
and sinister creature.

The Portuguese man 0' war.

It floats with the help
of a gas-filled bladder,

propped by a vertical membrane.

With that serving as a sail,

it maintains a steady course
through the waves.

Long threads trail behind it,

some as much as 30 metres long.

Each is armed with
many thousands of stinging cells.

A single tentacle could kill a fish,

or, in rare cases, a human.

But among its lethal tentacles,

lurks a man 0' war fish

that feeds by nibbling them.

Whilst this fish
has some resistance to the stings,

it must still be extremely careful.

Most other fish are not so lucky.

A tentacle has caught
this one, and reels it in.

It's already paralysed.

Specialised muscular tentacles

transfer the victim to others
that digest the catch,

liquefying it with powerful chemicals.

Eventually all that is left

is a scaly husk.

This voracious man 0' war

may collect over a hundred
small fish in a day.

For the most part,
the big blue seems featureless.

A place where the winds blow,
uninterrupted by land.

But beneath the surface,

there are long
mountain ranges, deep trenches,

and isolated volcanic peaks

that make it far more varied
than the human eye can see.

We're only just discovering
in any detail

how the inhabitants
of the big blue exploit that.

A lonely whale shark

on a special journey.

She is as long as a small aircraft,

and she weighs over 20 tonnes.

Like many sharks, she does not lay eggs,

but gives birth to live young.

She carries up to 500 of them

in her swollen belly.

She may be the biggest fish in the sea,

but the place where whale sharks
give birth has not yet been found.

Today, however, we may be a step
closer to solving this mystery.

We have known
that great numbers of whale sharks,

at certain times of the year,

appear around the Galapagos Islands.

Here they assemble around a tiny islet

that rises abruptly
from particularly deep water.

It's known as Darwin Island.

Here, swirling currents
bring out nutrients from the deep,

so enriching these waters

that they attract
great concentrations of fish

from far and wide.

Thousands of hammerhead sharks
also assemble here.

They are nearly all female.

They, too, it seems,
have come here to breed.

The whale shark receives
an extraordinary welcome.

Silky sharks,
themselves three metres long,

bounce against her rough skin,

perhaps to scrape off
any parasites they might have.

These sharks could be a danger
to any newly-born young.

So, perhaps to avoid them,

the whale shark dives

down to around 600 metres.

And there, she may release her young.

In these great depths,

away from the predators
that hunt in the waters above,

and with abundant food,

her babies could grow
and eventually disperse.

No one, it is true,

has ever seen young ones
in these little-visited depths.

But the fact that hundreds
of expectant whale sharks

come here every year,

is strong evidence that somewhere here

lies the nursery
of the biggest fish in the sea.

There are almost 50,000 sizeable islands

scattered across the world's oceans.

One of them is South Georgia.

An ideal place for those ocean-dwellers

who are compelled to land
in order to breed.

The wandering albatross.

It may spend as much
as a year continuously at sea,

searching for food,

gliding on wings that are
three and a half metres across.

The biggest of any living bird.

The entire world population

of 76, 000 Wanderers
nest on South Georgia

and half a dozen or so
of the other smaller islands

that lie in the Southern Ocean.

It's spring.

And this bird is returning
to the nest site it has always used.

Its lifelong partner is already here.

In South Georgia,

individual birds have been
studied for their entire lives

revealing that older pairs
in their late thirties

will go to extraordinary lengths

to give their young
the best possible start in life.

This chick is now several weeks old,

but still has its warm, downy coat.

The chick will need a regular
supply of regurgitated fish and squid.

With food so scarce in the open ocean,

both parents may have to scour
thousands of square miles

just to provide enough for one meal.

Ageing parents struggle on
all through the Antarctic winter,

to raise a chick that is big,
strong and healthy.

After some 130 days,

the youngster begins to replace
its down with flight feathers.

Finally, nine months
after their egg was laid,

this chick is ready to leave.

Of all the chicks
they've reared in recent years,

such a favoured chick
will have the best chance of survival.

But it will also be their last.

Elderly parents never recover
from their exertions.

They will soon leave this island,

never to be seen again.

Surviving in the open ocean

has always tested animals to the limit.

But today, they face a new,
additional threat.

Plastic.

just over a hundred years ago,

we invented a wonderful new material

that could be moulded
into all kinds of shapes.

And we took great trouble to ensure

that it was hard-wearing, waterproof,

and virtually indestructible.

Now, every year,

we dump around eight million
tonnes of it into the sea.

Here, it entangles and drowns
vast numbers of marine creatures.

But it has even more widespread
and far-reaching consequences.

A pod of short-finned pilot whales.

They live together in,
what are perhaps,

the most closely-knit of families
in the whole ocean.

Today, in the Atlantic waters
off Europe, as elsewhere,

they have to share
the ocean with plastic.

A mother is holding
her new-born young.

It's dead.

She is reluctant to let it go

and has been carrying
it around for many days.

As plastic breaks down,
it combines with other pollutants

that are consumed
by vast numbers of marine creatures.

In top predators like these,

the toxic chemicals
can build up to lethal levels.

It's possible her calf
may have been poisoned

by her own contaminated milk.

Pilot whales have big brains.

They can certainly experience emotions.

judging from
the behaviour of the adults,

the loss of the infant
has affected the entire family.

Unless the flow of plastics
into the world's oceans is reduced,

marine life will be poisoned by them
for many centuries to come.

The creatures
that live in the big blue

are, perhaps, more remote
than any animals on the planet.

But not remote enough, it seems,

to escape the effects of what
we are doing to their world.

Next time, we journey
into the bountiful green sea.

These are enchanted worlds,

home to strange creatures...

...where only the most ingenious
will triumph.

In the far north,

after three dark months of winter,

a world is waiting

for a trigger.

The sunshine of spring.

Starfish are the first to respond.

They race for the highest point,

and, sensing changes in the water,

with the tips of their tube feet,

they spawn.

Sea cucumbers,

with only their mouths exposed,

HOW emerge.

They collect as many
starfish eggs as they can.

Which is quite a lot
when you've got ten arms.

Now sea pens

rise up to claim a share.

The creatures here

must grab what they can
of this annual banquet.

For the light has also set in motion,

the greatest transformation of all.

Fronds of kelp,

a marine alga, rise towards the surface,

lifted by their gas-filled bladders.

Soon, a marine forest has materialised.

Teeming with life of all kinds,

these green seas

are some of the most productive
but fiercely competitive waters

in all the oceans.

The southern tip of Africa.

Here two great oceans collide.

In the shallows,

fed by rich currents,

are bountiful forests of kelp.

Barely visible, except for
the pulsating siphons

through which it breathes,

a common octopus waiting for prey
to pass by.

A crab will do.

The octopus sets off in pursuit.

And then lurks

with the patience of an ambush hunter.

But the octopus shares the Cape waters

with a great concentration
of other predators.

Fur seals,

and sharks.

They all eat octopus,

if they can find one.

And Pyjama Sharks are experts

at hunting in the undergrowth.

Time to disappear.

But these tough-skinned little sharks

are small enough to reach deep
into crevices.

But the octopus is far from finished.

She slips her tentacles
into the shark's gills.

That prevents the shark from breathing.

So the shark has to let go.

When caught out
in the open and vulnerable,

this octopus does something
truly extraordinary,

and never recorded before.

She disguises herself

with a protective armour of shells.

She's hiding

in plain sight.

The shark can sense its prey.

But the shells confuse it.

In a forest full of hungry mouths,

superior wits allow this octopus
to stay alive.

Forests of kelp

flourish in seasonal waters
around the globe,

particularly along the Pacific Coast
of North America.

Here, the biggest kelps of all

grow in vast forests,

stretching for hundreds of miles.

In some places,

the giant fronds rise up
to 60 metres tall.

The thickets they create

are crowded with life.

Competition here for space and food

is intense.

A challenging problem

for the Garibaldi fish.

He tends to his patch of seaweed

filled with tiny creatures that he eats.

As with most farmers,

his work never ends.

He removes snails and any other grazers

that come to eat his algae.

No matter how big they are.

He has to deal with pests of all kinds.

This can be the worst of them.

Sea urchins that can scrape off
every vestige of algae from a rock.

Its spines are needle sharp.

Somehow the Garibaldi must remove it.

But the problem with sea urchins

is that they just keep coming.

When evening arrives
and the light fades,

he has to stop.
He not only needs a rest,

he needs to hide.

Because at night,

predators prowl through these forests.

A Torpedo Ray,

capable of stunning its victim
with 45 volts of electricity.

While the Garibaldi hides,

the urchins can feed
without interruption.

The light returns,

and he finds his farm is once again

under attack.

Urchins like locusts,

have the ability to swarm

and this can be disastrous

not just for the Garibaldi,

but for the kelp forest itself.

All the vegetation is now under attack.

The urchins move through the forest

cutting through the kelp fronds

and leaving behind vast barrens.

These urchin armies

have felled many kelp forests

along the Pacific Coast
of North America.

But help is at hand.

Sea otters.

All other kinds of otters spend much
of their lives on land.

But sea otters rarely leave the water.

At first, a newly born pup

is not a very good swimmer.

So its mother spends hours

grooming its fur to make it buoyant.

But to provide her youngster with milk,

and keep herself warm

she must eat up to 50%
of her bodyweight every day.

She does that by eating shellfish.

And urchins are among a sea otter's
favourite delicacies.

In the past, sea otters were hunted
so intensively for their fur,

that they came close to extinction.

With them gone,

many kelp forests were replaced with

urchin barrens.

Today, sea otters are protected.

And as their numbers slowly return,

many of the kelp forests
are recovering too.

Now, in some remote places,

sea otters are so numerous,

they assemble in huge wafts.

Something that hasn't been seen

for over a century.

In the sun drenched
shallows off Australia,

kelp is replaced by the sea 's
only flowering plants,

sea grass.

The most extensive of these marine
grasslands

can stretch for over 3,000 square miles.

All across the Tropics,

they're patrolled by tiger sharks.

They can grow
up to five metres in length.

And have powerful crushing jaws.

Green turtles are their prey.

The turtles feed almost entirely
on sea grass.

A single one can consume
up to two kilos of it in a day.

But they can never rest easy.

Healthy turtles will keep well away
from an approaching shark.

And just by keeping the turtles
on the move,

the sharks prevent
any one patch of sea grass

from being overgrazed.

And that has benefits for us all.

A patch of sea grass

can absorb and store
55 times as much carbon dioxide

as the same area of a rainforest.

So the prairies and their sharks

are surprising allies in the fight

against a warming climate.

The struggle to survive
in our green seas

can have far reaching consequences.

Once a year,

one particular meadow in Australia,

is transformed.

Around the first full moon of winter,

an army materialises.

Spider crabs.

For the past year
they've been feeding in deeper waters.

Now, they march across
the sea grass plains.

Hundreds of thousands of them.

They clamber over one another

creating great mounds

nearly a hundred metres long.

They're not seeking mates

neither are they laying eggs.

They have come here in order

to grow.

Like all crabs, their bodies
are enclosed in a hard

unexpandable shell.

So to grow,
they have to break out of it.

And that allows the soft one
that has developed beneath

to expand.

It will take days
for the new shell to harden.

Its legs are so limp,

that they won't work properly.

The crab is unprotected

and in great danger.

A smooth stingray.

It's huge, about four metres long.

It wants a soft, freshly moulted crab

that will be easier to eat.

The crabs try to stick together.

But now, disturbed by the ray,

they're scattering.

A newly moulted crab

is too weak to keep up with the crowd.

The safest place is right
in the middle of the pile.

That is why they have
all assembled here.

There is safety in numbers.

But the vast majority
of the crabs escape.

And within the next few days,

they will be ready to return
to the depths,

and resume their lonely wanderings

in search of food.

This is no graveyard.

But the triumph
of a hundred thousand crabs,

successfully moulted.

The green seas of Southern Australia,

are particularly rich in such
spectacular assemblies.

But most of the creatures come together
for a very different reason,

to breed.

The giant cuttlefish.

The largest of all cuttlefish.

They live for just one or two years.

Now, as the Australian summer
draws to an end,

they have one last act to complete.

To find a mate.

But there are
over one hundred thousand males

competing for the arriving females

in this one bay.

Among them, a giant, a true goliath.

He probably weighs about ten kilos.

Bands of colour sweep across his skin.

That's how cuttlefish communicate.

This smaller male couldn't
possibly take him on.

Beside Goliath and under his protection,

a female who has just mated with him.

But other rivals are still interested.

It seems a small male
wouldn't stand a chance.

The female is now displaying
a white stripe

along her side nearest Goliath.

It's a clear signal that she no longer
wants to mate with him.

It's all the encouragement
that the little male needs.

He's going to have to use trickery.

He tones down his colours,

and tucks in his arms.

He's just the right size to mimic
a female.

Goliath is deceived.

The small male now
displays a white stripe,

just like the real female

to deter his advances.

He slips beside her.

And they mate.

By mating with multiple partners,

the female ensures
the greatest genetic diversity

for her young.

The sneaky male leaves,

his final act complete.

So even among giant cuttlefish,
it seems,

it's not all about size.

Other males
in these Australian green pastures,

take greater responsibility
for their young.

A Weedy Sea Dragon.

This is a male

and he's carrying a precious cargo.

While mating with the female,

he collected the eggs

and attached them to his underside.

Now, he's leaving the seaweed thickets

and travelling into more open waters

where elaborate camouflage
is less effective.

And there are many predators out here.

And this is what the fathers
risk their lives for.

Dense clouds of minute shrimp.

Mysids.

One of a sea dragon's favourite foods.

They're drawing other sea dragons
out here too.

Finally, it's time for the young
to break free.

But algae has grown over
these developing eggs.

And it risks smothering them.

Nonetheless, the babies are emerging.

They've hatched successfully.

The fathers return to the tangle of kelp

where they're virtually invisible.

While the young remain out here.

But they will grow quickly,

surrounded as they are
by their ideal food.

Vast numbers of the ocean's young fish,

start their lives in the green seas.

One of the richest nurseries of all,
are the mangrove forests.

Fringing the coastline of the Tropics,

they form a natural protective barrier
between land and sea,

and are some of the world's most
productive forests.

Below the water,
their arching aerial roots

give them a firm footing.

Here there's abundant food
for baby fish.

While the tangled roots protect them
from bigger fish,

and other predators that haunt
the channels.

But in Northern Australia

with the receding tide,

the little fish are forced
to leave their shelter.

And now, they're vulnerable.

It's the most deadly assassin
in the green seas.

The Zebra Mantis Shrimp.

A male, almost 40 centimetres long.

But he's not hunting just for himself.

He's collecting food for his mate.

She may have been his partner
for 20 years.

She relies on him to bring her food.

And puts her energy
into her eggs instead.

In a world so full of food,

this would seem a sensible strategy.

But it's also a risky one.

Were her male to disappear,
she could starve.

Something has caught
this mate's attention.

Perhaps an irresistible odour

or a distant call.

Whatever the reason,
a male will leave his burrow

and his lifelong mate.

An even larger hole.

Females who have lost their mates

appear to send out distress signals

to call in a new male.

A larger female will produce more eggs.

So by mating with her,

he will father more offspring.

But infidelity comes at a price.

A larger partner demands more food.

The richer a sea,
the greater the competition.

And there is one green sea

that supports more life
than all the rest combined.

Unlike the mangrove forests
and the sea grass prairies,

its location is in the open seas,

and only temporary and unpredictable.

This greenness comes
not from rooted plants,

but from clouds of floating ones.

Billions of microscopic phytoplankton

are proliferating.

And in such numbers,

that they fuel one
of the greatest feasts of all.

Off America's Pacific Coast,

hundreds of common dolphins
are rushing to a banquet.

They're not the only ones homing in.

So are sea lions.

They're heading
for Monterey Bay, California,

where algal blooms have caused
an explosion,

in plankton feeders.

Anchovies,

millions of them.

The dolphins herd the anchovies
towards the surface.

Sea birds and sea lions
take advantage of the shoals appearance.

It's a race to grab a share
before others arrive.

Hump Back Whales,

hundreds of them.

With every upward lunge, they sieve
out up to a 100 kilos of fish.

They're claiming the biggest share
of one of the biggest feasts on earth.

So crucial are these tiny plankton,

that almost all marine life ultimately
depends upon them.

It's the green seas, not the blue

that are the basis of almost all life

in the world's oceans.

Next time on Blue Planet II,

we meet the creatures
that live where two worlds collide.

And discover how they cope with the
demands of the ever-changing coasts.


An olive ridley turtle.

She's resting in the shallows
off Costa Rica,

having swum a thousand miles to be here.

All because the eggs she carries
must be laid on dry land.

Now she's returned
to the very same beach

where she hatched 10 years ago.

She must leave the safety
of her marine world

and brave the alien world beyond.

She's heavily laden

but the future of the next generation
of her kind is at stake.

All along the beach in a spectacle
that has remained unchanged

for millions or years,

mother sea turtles emerge from the ocean

in their hundreds of thousands.

Only those animals
that overcome the great challenges

of both land and sea

can make the most of life
here on the coast.

Our shores are places of sudden changes
and rich rewards.

The Galapagos Islands
in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Their barren coastline
looks inhospitable,

but one group of animals has learnt
to use it to their advantage.

Sea lions.

Bachelors.

They need to pile on the pounds

as only the biggest males will attract
a female and manage to breed.

If these young bulls
fail to grow big enough,

they will remain exiled
on this isolated shoreline.

So one hungry young bull
heads out alone.

He's on the hunt for big game.

Yellowfin tuna.

Each weighing 60 kilos

with a top speed of 40 miles an hour.

He can't possibly catch one
in the open sea,

but he has a plan.

Ahead lies the entrance to the cove.

He herds them towards it

into his trap.

Driving them into a dead end.

But they give him the slip.

He's failed.

But there might be another way.

Now they head off as a team

to round up more tuna,

driving them back into the cove.

The sea lions fan out channelling
the tuna towards the bottleneck.

Once again the tuna hit the dead end.

But this time,
the young bull doubles back

to act as a blocker
sealing off the exit.

This time when the shoal
tries to escape,

he blocks them and drives them back
into the next blind alley.

The gang can now pick them off
one by one.

This clever fishing technique,

demanding foresight,
planning and cooperation,

has only every been seen here
in the Galapagos.

Each massive fish provides them
with five times more protein

than a normal day's hunting.

Finally, the young bull leaves his post

to claim his reward.

On a diet of protein-rich tuna,

he's well on the way to becoming
a full-sized breeding bull.

By using this cove,

these Galapagos sea lions
have made the most of the opportunities

that occur
where the coast's two worlds meet.

Coasts are the most swiftly changing
of all ocean habitats

because of the tides.

Tides are created as the moon's gravity
pulls at the sea.

As the moon circles our planet,
the seas rise and fall.

Typically twice a day,

creating the most constantly dynamic
landscapes on Earth.

Nowhere else do sea-living creatures
face such changeable conditions.

With the daily risk of drying out
and being scorched by the sun.

Where the tide retreats
across a rocky shore,

it can leave behind a temporary oasis.

A rock pool.

Seemingly, it's a haven of calm.

But not for long.

Turning minutes into seconds
reveals unexpected dramas.

In rock pools, grazers, scavengers
and filter feeders

must all make the most
of the few short hours

before the tide returns.

Anemones gulp down
anything they can reach.

Though some meals
are harder to digest than others.

These magical worlds
soon become battlegrounds.

A deadly predator with five arms
and on the underside a mouth.

The ochre starfish.

And it's in search of limpets.

For some, there is no escape.

But other limpets have a secret defence.

They deploy a slippery shield

which allows them to slide to safety.

And this limpet
has its own personal bodyguard.

A scale worm with a nasty nip.

The starfish prefers food
that doesn't bite back.

The limpet carries on,

its bodyguard
tucked safe under its shell.

But there is one creature

that limpets have no defence against.

A clingfish.

It has teeth
that can lever under the shell

and twist the limpet off
like a bottle top.

The clingfish then swallows it

shell and all.

Rock pool dramas like these
last just a few short hours

before the tide returns.

Every day the sea becomes land
and the land becomes sea.

Bringing new opportunities.

A Sally Lightfoot crab,

one of thousands of shore crabs
just waiting for their moment.

Every day they gather
on the tropical shores of Brazil,

waiting for the tide to go out.

Which exposes their feeding ground,

seaweed covered rocks,
a hundred metres from the shore.

Getting there is a race
against the tide.

They leap from rock to rock.

These crabs seem
to be afraid of the water.

And for good reason.

The Moray eel.

The chain Moray
is a specialist crab hunter.

It's blunt teeth can easily grip
and crush a crab's shell.

It's the crab's deadliest enemy.

But the crab's feeding grounds
are still a long way off.

They must press on.

Halfway.

But their enemy has other ideas.

Crossing the land

to reset the ambush.

To feed, the crabs must keep going.

But nowhere is safe.

An octopus. Also a crab killer.

The crabs make a dash for it.

Made it.

Risking life and limb

to graze on these seaweed pastures.

But in two hours' time
when the tide starts to turn,

they will have to run the gauntlet
all over again.

Tides are not the only force
to have an impact on the coast.

The greatest waves
originate far out to sea

and roll in towards the coast,
growing as they come.

As the shallowing sea floor
drags at their underside,

their crests rise
up to a hundred feet high,

topple over and break.

Many of the biggest surfed waves
in the world

are formed off Nazare in Portugal.

Every day along this coast,
the impact of the waves is equivalent

to one and a half million tonnes of TNT.

Wave power gradually moulds
and reshapes our coasts.

In some parts of Europe,

waves wear away as much as three metres
of coastline each year.

The rate at which the waves
reshape the rock

depends on its hardness.

Where soft rock lies below hard,

dramatic arches are craved.

It's an endless assault

that gradually sculpts
vaulted cathedrals of stone

as here in northern Spain.

And wave power
creates towering fortresses

like these cliffs in these Arctic,

home to tens of thousands
of breeding seabirds.

The faces of the cliffs
are accessible only from the air

and have plenty of nooks and crannies
for those that can get there.

But to feed, seabirds must still master
the ocean world beyond.

The puffin.

He's a fisherman...

...and a father.

He has a mate for life.

Both share the burden of raising
their week-old chick,

their puffling who needs
five square meals a day.

The parents alternate fishing trips.

It's dad's turn.

When fish stocks are low,

puffins must fly as much as 30 miles

to reach the good fishing grounds.

Once there,
they plunge into another world.

Good fishing spots are hard to come by,
and they have company.

Guillemots.

Like the puffin, their wings are short
and good for diving.

Puffins can hold their breath
for over a minute

and dive as deep as 40 metres.

A catch.

But it's a long way home.

After an exhausting round trip
of almost 60 miles,

this puffin's nearly made it.

But there are pirates on this coast.

Arctic Skuas.

All around returning parents
are being robbed.

The skuas' long rake back wings

make them faster and more manoeuvrable.

Puffins must choose their moment wisely.

A near miss.

A last desperate burst of speed,

and it's made it.

Safely home
after a three-hour round trip...

...where his patient partner is waiting.

Today their puffling will eat.

But where fish numbers are in decline,

many puffins now find it hard
to get enough food for their chicks.

In the changing seas of today,

it can be even harder
to be a successful puffin parent.

Overcoming the challenges
of two worlds is seldom easy.

One marine creature has virtually
abandoned the sea altogether.

On a few remote pacific islands,

lives the most terrestrial fish
on the planet.

At the top of this metre-high
limestone cliff,

an eight-centimetre long blenny
has chosen a nest hole.

Up here, he can graze
on the abundant algae

without any competition
from sea-going fish.

The females are feeding beneath him.

He's keen to attract their attention,

but they are busy moisturising.

Staying damp is essential
as they breathe through their skin.

To make himself conspicuous,
he turns black

and flashes his orange fin.

He catches her eye.

But these Pacific leaping blennies,

seem afraid of the waves.

They're poor swimmers

and will be easy prey in the sea.

Time to try again.

She's tempted.

But once again distracted by a wave.

The male just won't give up.

Finally, she's hooked.

He makes way...

so she can enter his cave.

And he encourages her to lay her eggs

with his seductive dance.

He then fertilizes them
in the safety of his nest.

The blenny has given up the sea
for a life on land.

Others have made
an even more successful move

but in a different direction.

Penguins have abandoned flying

and instead spend
most of their lives swimming.

Their sleek survival suits
of tightly packed feathers

are perfect for these freezing waters.

Yet, they must still come ashore
once a year.

South Georgia, an island wilderness
close to Antarctica.

Each spring, its beaches become
the busiest on Earth

as hundreds of thousands
of king penguins return here.

They're heading for the colony.

But in their way lies the biggest wall
of blubber on the planet.

Elephant seals.

It's the breeding season

and the four-tonne bulls are fighting
for control of their harems.

Best to wait for them to calm down.

He can't fly over this barrier,

so he will have to walk
as unobtrusively as possible.

And hope that sleeping giants
will continue to lie.

Careful.

This could be tricky.

A rival bull mounts a challenge.

The penguins could be caught
in the crossfire.

Eight tonnes of blubber collide.

The towering beach master is victorious.

In the confusion,
this penguin slips through.

Ahead are 40,000 chicks.

Hungry and over-excited.

But not every penguin
has a chick to feed.

That's not why they're here.

There is another reason.

There is a trial of endurance
that every penguin must face,

and it starts with a persistent itch.

His survival suit has been worn thin

by months of swimming
in the rough southern ocean.

His solution is drastic.

Shed all four layers of feathers
as quickly as possible.

The process is known
as a catastrophic moult.

Until their feathers regrow,

penguins will remain rooted to the spot.

Having starved for a month,

they're now fully waterproofed
and insulated once more.

Lean, hungry and eager to return
to a life at sea.

Thanks to their waterproof plumage,

penguins are able to make
the most of both worlds

even in some of the harshest conditions
on Earth.

The coasts of South Georgia

are currently protected
by their remoteness.

Other coastlines
are much more vulnerable,

and they are now changing
faster than ever before.

Two thirds of our major cities
are on our coasts.

It's estimated that in the next decade,

we can expect 10%
of the world's remaining wild shores

to be taken over by human development.

Yet every year,
just off Florida's Palm Beach

and extraordinary spectacle appears
almost unnoticed.

The biggest gathering of coastal sharks
on the planet.

Spinners and blacktips.

Ten thousand of them.

Every January,
they seek out these warm shallows

as a stopover
on their migration northwards.

Sharks have been gathering here
since long before people arrived.

But today, they face levels of pollution

and habitat degradation
as well as fishing pressures.

that their ancestors
would never have experienced.

It's not longer enough
for coastal creatures

to master their own worlds.

Now they must face the many challenges
that come from our world, too.

Next time...

We travel the world to uncover
the biggest issues facing the ocean...

meet the passionate people

who've devoted their lives
to protecting it

and discover what the future holds
for our blue planet.
