NARRATOR: In the waters off the east coast of South Africa, 300 feet below the surface, divers search for a creature that existed before the time of the dinosaurs, a living fossil.

VOICE:	It's three hundred and fifty, four hundred million years old.

NARRATOR: Some call it the, "Ghost Fish, King of the Sea," others, "Monster of the Deep."

VOICE:	On a moonless but fairly bright night you can actually see those eyes glowing.

NARRATOR: For over half a century the search has persisted.

VOICE:	There have been divers who've died trying to find these fish.

NARRATOR: Those who come in contact with it are changed forever.

VOICE:	You get this kind of science fiction chill on the back of your neck and going down your spine.

NARRATOR: ...a creature that offers tantalizing clues to the evolution of all life on Earth, including us.

VOICE:	I did see one alive, and I never got over that.

NARRATOR: A creature thought to have been extinct for over 50 million years.

Voice in Frankenstein trailer: It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!"

NARRATOR: In Sodwana Bay, South Africa, a team of divers prepares to attempt a descent of several hundred feet into the Indian Ocean to search for a mysterious, ancient creature.

Deep dives here are always dangerous. Rescue divers are in place. An emergency medical team hovers nearby. Each diver carries several tanks, different compressed gases to breathe at different depths. Any mix-up here could be fatal.

DIVER 1:	This is my oxygen. It's closed—cannot breathe this at depths deeper than 10 meters. This is air to travel down. And on my back I have a helium mixture to breathe at depth.

NARRATOR: Everything is planned down to the minute.

DIVER 2:	Our total dive is going to take us exactly two hours, so 15 minutes down and on the bottom, and the rest of the time coming up.

One, two, three, go.

NARRATOR: For a quarter of an hour, they drift down through a world ever quieter, ever colder, ever darker. Then, at a depth of 300 feet, something catches their eye.

DIVER 3:	We saw the Continental drop-off. We headed straight for it. We saw a cave. We went straight into that cave, just looked underneath it: there he was.

NARRATOR: A great primitive fish, a Coelacanth—its ancestors date back 400 million years, to a time when all earth's creatures lived under water, and the great transition to living on land was about to begin. Was the Coelacanth, with its fleshy, leg-like fins, the missing link in evolution from fish to land animals?

Coelacanths were long considered extinct, known to science only through ancient fossils that displayed these curious limb-like fins. But one fateful day in 1938, everything changed.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER (Former Curator, East London Museum): Hello. Welcome. Welcome to 6 Lake Street.

NARRATOR: Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer was then the 31-year old curator of a small natural history museum in East London, South Africa.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: Come in.

NARRATOR: She remembers well how her life was turned upside down by the mysterious Coelacanth.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: Nobody ever knew the difficulties and the, the trauma that I went through. I went through absolute trauma saving that fish, because nobody wanted to know. As I say, even my family, in the end, began to think I was cuckoo—suppose I was being cuckoo.

NARRATOR: On December 22, 1938, a fishing trawler steamed into the East London harbor. On the deck was a pile of sea life dredged up after a freak storm. But these fish were not all meant for market.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: It was a pile of sponges and starfish and rat-tail fish and...you name it they were there.

NARRATOR: When putting together new exhibits at the museum, Marjorie often obtained samples from local fishermen.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: And then, from underneath this crowd, there was this one fin sticking out, this blue fin. And I thought, "What on earth could this be?" Then I moved all the fish. There was this beautiful, beautiful fish...iridescent colors all over the fish. It was solid. It was just on five-foot long, rough scales and very big eyes, very big blue eyes, these peculiar limb-like fins, something that I've never seen in a fish in my life.

NARRATOR: Marjorie had been an avid collector since childhood. She knew instinctively that this was an important find.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: I thought, "Now, whatever happens, this fish has got to be saved."

NARRATOR: Although she was able cart the fish back to the museum, this was 1938, and there was no easy way to refrigerate and preserve the specimen. She inquired at the local mortuary.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: And so I went in, and this very tall, very gaunt looking gentleman said what could he do for me. So I said, "You know I've got this beautiful fish." I said, "I have to try and save it, and I wondered if you could put it into the mortuary." So he drew himself up, right nearly up to the roof, and he said, "I've never heard of such an iniquitous suggestion. Most definitely not. Most definitely not!"

NARRATOR: In desperation, she sent off a note and a sketch to a professor at Rhodes University, 100 miles away in Grahamstown. Professor J.L.B. Smith was trained as a chemist, but his passion was ichthyology, the study of fish. His work in this field would soon change the face of science.

JEAN POTE (Former Secretary and Archivist for J.L.B. Smith): Let me take you to L4.

NARRATOR: Professor Smith's onetime secretary and archivist is Jean Pote.

JEAN POTE:	This is it. This is a very interesting file. It's correspondence with Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer from 1936 onwards. And in this file is, I think, the original drawing. That is the original drawing by Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer. And as soon as he saw that, he knew it was something really rare.

NARRATOR: For J.L.B. Smith, it was more than rare; it was an impossibility. If that drawing were correct, this fish should have died out with the dinosaurs.

Smith's wife, Margaret, described his reaction.

MARGARET SMITH (Wife of J.L.B. Smith): It was the third of January, 1939, and I suddenly felt almost shock waves coming from my husband, who was standing up reading a letter. And through the back of the letter I could see a picture of a fish. And he pointed to the drawing of the tail. And he said, "You see that tail. That tail belongs to fishes that have been extinct for millions and millions of years."

NARRATOR: Smith was confused and puzzled. He almost hoped he was wrong about the identification of this creature. But if he was right, the implications were staggering. Despite his initial excitement, he was unable to examine the fish in person for nearly two months, leaving Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer to deal with this strange creature alone.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: He probably thought I was making a mistake. And I'd sketched it, and I had written all these letters to him about it, but he probably thought, you know, I was young and inexperienced with ichthyology. It's a funny thing to just suddenly decide to bring a fossil fish out into the open.

NARRATOR: Marjorie was left with no choice. In order to save the fish for scientific study, she had it skinned and mounted. But without any preservatives, the internal organs had to be discarded. This was later described by Smith as one of the most terrible tragedies in science.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: So there were a lot of confusions in the beginning, and I got blamed for losing the innards of the fish. I had to bear that all my life. But still, the main thing was that we saved the thing; we saved the skin and the type specimen.

On the 16th of February, at 10 o'clock, Professor Smith walked into my office. I'd been waiting for him since the 22nd of December.

NARRATOR: "That first sight hit me like a white-hot blast," Smith later wrote. "It made me feel shaky and queer, my body tingled. I stood as if stricken to stone."

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: And he walked 'round the table. And he said, "Lass, this fish will be on the lips of every scientist in the world. It's a Coelacanth."

NARRATOR: Since J.L.B. Smith identified the strange fish, he was able to christen it. He named the genus "Latimeria," after the woman who had saved the fish for science, and the species, "chalumnae" after the river near where it was caught.

The press went wild with the news, calling it the most important scientific discovery of the century. A creature from a group thought to be extinct for millions of years was alive. It was a living fossil, a window into the past.

The term "living fossil" had been coined by Darwin. In his writings on evolution, he argued that somewhere, most likely in the ocean depths, some creatures would have eluded the pressures to evolve, and changed little from prehistoric times.

Now here was a living Coelacanth, strikingly similar to fossils more than 50 million years old.

JOHN MAISEY (Paleontologist, American Museum of Natural History): Well, we're down in the basement of the museum now, and the fossil fish collection is through here.

NARRATOR: John Maisey is a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

JOHN MAISEY:	Collections are arranged in a systematic sequence or in an evolutionary sequence. And the Coelacanth fossils we keep in these cabinets.

For example, here are some small Coelacanths from, well, from right around here. These probably lived in fresh water. These are about a shade over 200 million years old. And these didn't get much bigger than this. These Coelacanths lived at a time when North America was still attached to Africa so New York would have been very close to Morocco at this time.

NARRATOR: Coelacanths first appeared, along with the other major groups of fishes we know today, about 400 million years ago. Then the Earth was, more or less, one large landmass. Over time, this super-continent separated into what is now essentially the modern globe, leaving Coelacanth fossils on every continent except Antarctica.

These fossils had been known to science since the 1830s. They'd been found in widely varying sizes, but with several distinguishing features: an oddly hinged joint in the head, fins that had a limb-like structure, and hollow fin rays supporting the distinctive tail. The oddly spelled name comes from the Greek, meaning hollow spine.

J.L.B. Smith wrote that finding a living Coelacanth was, "like walking down the street and running into a dinosaur."

Scientists were skeptical that the fish in East London was a true living fossil. Even Smith worried that perhaps the Coelacanth had "lain somewhere in the ocean bed in some preserving ooze or mud these millions of years." But Marjorie soon assured him that the fish had snapped at its captors before dying.

The press played up the idea of a missing link, an idea also derived from Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin proposed that life came out of the sea, evolving from fishes to amphibians to mammals to us over millions of years.

Was the Coelacanth a missing link—that interim step from water to land? Was this fish the key to understanding our own evolution?

JOHN MCCOSKER (Evolutionary Biologist, California Academy of Sciences): All life came from the sea. And when we realize that life is really just an evolution of forms, these are the closest relatives to our ancestors. And then we, intellectually, would like to know, "Who was the closest? Who was the missing link?"

NARRATOR: John McCosker is an evolutionary biologist at the California Academy of Sciences.

JOHN MCCOSKER: We're dying to know, "What was that step from the fishes to the amphibians?" And when they discovered Coelacanth fossils they said, "Aha, it must be this, this thing that walked out of the water." And when they discovered the living fossil they said, "That's it. Our ancestor, it's alive."

NARRATOR: But Marjorie's fish was all they had. And it was only skin and bones. The innards had been lost.

J.L.B. SMITH:	And we were, by such unfortunate circumstances, prevented from being able to find out what most of its body and organs were like.

NARRATOR: Were the Coelacanth's internal organs like those of other fishes or more like those of amphibians, reptiles and mammals?

J.L.B. SMITH:	And, therefore, it became more than nominally desirable, really imperative to find more.

NARRATOR: This would become J.L.B. Smith's life's work, to find another Coelacanth, and this time an intact specimen.

MIKE BRUTON (Ecologist, University of Cape Town): J.L.B. Smith was a hard man. He was a very, very focused man. And that tended to turn people off who didn't share his point of view.

NARRATOR: Mike Bruton works today as an ecologist, here in South Africa. He studied under J.L.B. Smith.

MIKE BRUTON:	Well, J.L.B. was a remarkable fisherman and actually predicted that the first Coelacanth didn't naturally live off East London, that it was a more tropical deep-water animal.

NARRATOR: Smith felt certain that if Coelacanths were native to the highly fished waters off East London, they would have been caught many times before. He reasoned that Marjorie's fish inhabited the deep, tropical reefs to the North and had been driven toward East London by currents running down through the Mozambique Channel.

MIKE BRUTON:	So he distributed leaflets all over the East African coast.

NARRATOR: Smith's leaflets, in English, French and Portuguese, offered a hundred-pound reward, an enormous sum for a local fisherman. But he still faced tremendous odds against finding a second specimen. After all, the Coelacanth had proved amazingly adept at eluding discovery.

JOHN MCCOSKER: J.L.B. was a fisherman, a mad fisherman.

NARRATOR: As with the first specimen, caught by trawler fishermen, Smith was counting on those who made a living from the sea. And like Smith, biologist John McCosker knows where to ask when looking for a particular fish.

JOHN MCCOSKER: These men are the best ichthyologists, for sure. They know the differences between—the subtle differences—between different species, different populations. If you want to find rare fish, you don't go to an ichthyologist or a museum, you go to a fish market. And these guys know fish. I mean, it's their whole life, is fish.

NARRATOR: The fishermen of the Comoros Islands would prove to be a godsend for J.L.B. Smith. The Comoros are a small group of volcanic islands, then controlled by the French, just north of Madagascar. Here, men have fished in the same way for over a thousand years, and were said, occasionally, to pull out of the water a fish they called "Gombessa."

Comoran fishermen had no idea this fish might shed light on one of the greatest scientific mysteries of all time, but the substantial reward caught everyone's attention.

Then, in December, 1952, from the Comoros, Smith got the telegram he'd hoped and prayed for, for 14 years. It came from an English sea trader he'd met in Madagascar, Eric Hunt. "Have five-foot specimen Coelacanth. Injected formulin here. Killed twentieth. Advise."

Smith was beside himself. Did Hunt have enough preservative? It would take weeks to reach the Comoros by boat. By then the fish might putrefy. He'd not spent all these years searching to let this specimen slip away.

Smith turned to his connections in the South African government to try to borrow a plane, finally calling the Prime Minister himself, D.F. Malan.

MIKE BRUTON:	Malan was at his beach cottage, in 1952, when he got that famous phone call from J.L.B. Smith. And he realized that J.L.B. Smith had something important to tell him, that South Africa's prestige was at stake.

NARRATOR: As a South African, Mike Bruton remembers the story of the second Coelacanth well.

MIKE BRUTON: And as a result, Malan eventually gave permission for that military Dakota to fly to the Comoros. It's since been described as sort of a military airplane going to a foreign country taking a mad scientist to fetch a dead fish.

DUNCAN RALSTON (South African Air Force): Well this is Dakota 6832, the one we flew to fetch the Coelacanth in 1952.

NARRATOR: Major General Duncan Ralston was a lieutenant at the time and the senior navigator on the flight that took J.L.B. Smith to the Comoros.

DUNCAN RALSTON: Professor Smith actually sat about here. And he was so tense and so excited. We had a long flight over the sea. There was almost no navigational aids, but we landed, and there was the fish.

NARRATOR: The fish smelled strongly of the formaldehyde Hunt had used to try to preserve it. And it was a bit the worse for wear, having been carted across the island by the fisherman who caught it. Nevertheless, after 14 years of searching, Smith finally had his Coelacanth.

J.L.B. SMITH:	I could not bring myself to touch it. And I knelt down to look, and I'm not ashamed to say that after all that long strain, I wept.

DUNCAN RALSTON: Professor Smith insisted that we get this fish back to the airplane and take off as quickly as possible. I'm not sure to this day whether we did, in fact, have proper diplomatic clearance to land at the island or to take the fish away. I know subsequently the French government were enormously cross about the whole affair because they felt it belonged to them.

So we flew back. We had to fly the fish down to Cape Town because Dr. Malan wanted to see it. Dr. Malan said, when he saw the fish, "My, it's very ugly. And is this where we came from?"

NARRATOR: Malan was a creationist and the father of South African apartheid. Aiding Smith in his evolutionary research was dangerous politically, but South Africa's prestige was at stake, and Malan welcomed the publicity.

NEWSREEL REPORTER: Meet Professor Smith of Grahamstown, South Africa, with a model of that famous fish, the Coelacanth.

J.L.B. SMITH:	Coelacanths are close relatives of the fish that scientists consider was the ancestor of all land animals. The Coelacanths have lived for probably 350 million years and in that time they have changed but little.

NEWSREEL REPORTER: Yes the professor says the fish is a kind of ancestor of man, poor fish.

NARRATOR: In his lab, Smith began the first ever dissection of a Coelacanth, peering into a world never before accessible to science. What he discovered was that the Coelacanth is different in many ways from all other modern fish. Not only did it have strange, limb-like fins, it had no real backbone. Instead, Smith found a more primitive structure called a "notochord."

ROBIN STOBBS (South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity): This is part of the notochord of the Coelacanth that was dissected here. And it's simply a hollow tube. It's a gristly tube, which extends from just behind the brain right through into the tail, and it's filled with a light oil under a very slight pressure.

NARRATOR: This kind of oil-filled skeletal structure is unique. Most adult vertebrates have well-developed backbones, especially those that live on land, including human beings.

ROBIN STOBBS:	The entire fish is filled with oil. There is not a single air sinus in the fish. So, like a diver's depth gauge, it's incompressible, which, in theory anyway, would allow it to swim at depths of 1000 meters or more.

NARRATOR: But it was the limb-like fins that really caught the attention of Smith and the world. They had their own internal skeleton, more like our limbs than the fins of a normal fish.

J.L.B. SMITH:	As you see, the fins are more like paddles than ordinary fins. And indeed, our arms were developed from a pectoral fin like that of this fish. I have no doubt that this fish crawls about on the bottom quite easily.

NARRATOR: Once again, the press trumpeted the Coelacanth as the missing link, a creature that bridged the gap between fish and primitive land animals.

Scientists, museums, even zoos now wanted their own Coelacanth. The London Zoo offered a reward of 1,000 pounds for a live specimen.

Smith capitalized on the excitement surrounding his find. He wrote a book, Old Four Legs, and created a legend.

MIKE BRUTON:	Through Old Four Legs, which is one of the great scientific books of all time, he captured the public imagination. Partly because it's a fantastic fish, but I think we must give also credit to J.L.B. for a really good marketing exercise. He weaved the human story, the... all the intrigues of the Comoros—and he's working with a South African Prime Minister who didn't believe in evolution—and made the Coelacanth story come alive for people, gave them an entrée into this fantastic scientific world from which most people are excluded.

NARRATOR: Through his research and his book, Smith's name became forever tied to the Coelacanth, like Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer's. But what of the Comoran fisherman who actually caught the fish? He is seen here getting his reward. His name is Ahmed Houssein.

This is the first time he's been interviewed. Houssein says he never met Smith but recognizes his fish.

AHMED HOUSSEIN (Fisherman): We went fishing all night, caught the fish and came back in the morning. We found out it was the gombessa, Coelacanth, and it was taken to the capital.

NARRATOR: He says he got the reward, but other fishermen took credit for the catch.

Until this moment not even Houssein's own neighbors knew what he had done. But his catch back in 1952 put the Comoros on the scientific map. From then on, this tiny archipelago would be acknowledged as the prime location for finding Latimeria chalumnae.

As the islands were then under French colonial rule, an international embargo was declared. Comoran fisherman using the same time-honored methods of hook and line would catch many more Coelacanths. They would all be sent to France.

For the next 23 years, the Coelacanth was almost exclusively studied in the Department of Comparative Anatomy, here at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. Daniel Robineau was part of the team of scientists which conducted the first comprehensive dissections of Latimeria using properly preserved specimens.

DANIEL ROBINEAU (Museum of Natural History, Paris): This is one of the many specimens we received from the Comoros. A cut was made across the head giving us access to the inside of the skull. One can see very clearly the most interior part of the notochord.

NARRATOR: The French team found a series of contradictory features. In some ways, the Coelacanth looked very primitive, with organs and glands similar to those of sharks and rays, and a tiny heart, which is little more than an expansion in the main blood vessel. In other ways, the Coelacanth resembled tetrapods, those four-limbed creatures that include everything from the very first land-dwellers to human beings.

DANIEL ROBINEAU: There are several characteristics that show similarities to tetrapods. There's the presence of a vestigial lung and, of course, here are the lobed fins. And here on this X-ray, we can see the vein that brings the abdominal blood back up to the heart. This vessel is a genuine vena cava, like that found in tetrapods. The vascular system of almost all other fishes is completely different.

NARRATOR: So was the Coelacanth the closest living relative of tetrapods—the missing link? Some scientists said yes, others no, as they continued to explore this mysterious creature's anatomy.

ROBIN STOBBS:	Its brain, which, unfortunately, you can't see, is incredibly small. The, the brain case is, is probably about that size, but the brain itself is, is no bigger than the end segment of one's thumb.

NARRATOR: In the snout of the fish, a strange jelly-filled cavity was discovered. It initially puzzled researchers but is now thought to be an elaborate electro-receptive organ.

ROBIN STOBBS:	And we believe that this is used to detect minute electrical impulses put out by prey organisms.

Its eye, in life, looks much bigger than that, and it's like a crystal ball. It's, it's a clear, clear...clear as anything. And the Comorans say that, that coelacanths have fire in, in its eyes. And that's because it collects any light that's available and reflects it back, rather like a cat's eyes at night.

NARRATOR: These specialized features may help to explain why Coelacanths have survived for 400 million years. Their outward appearance has changed little, but internally, they must have adapted to changing environments as the Earth itself was transformed over time.

Whether the remarkable features of Latimeria developed four million years ago, or 40, or 400, we may never know. But it has found its niche and continues to avoid extinction, thanks, in part, to two other crucial adaptations: its advanced method of reproduction and its extremely low metabolism.

PHIL HEEMSTRA (South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity): So they wouldn't need much food. They're living, in fact, in a low food environment. There isn't a whole lot of food around for them. And this may have something to do with their long survival. They have adapted to this low food environment.

NARRATOR: Phil Heemstra has been studying Coelacanths for over two decades, and has been fascinated by the way they reproduce.

PHIL HEEMSTRA:	It looks like an orange, but it's actually a model of a Coelacanth egg. This is a life-size model. They have the largest eggs known amongst fishes.

NARRATOR: The huge Coelacanth eggs, filled with nutrients to feed the growing embryo, were discovered by the French in 1955. They were at first thought to be released and fertilized on the ocean floor, until a freshly dissected specimen yielded a surprise.

PHIL HEEMSTRA:	In 1975, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, they found a pregnant female with five babies inside her. So then we knew that they had internal fertilization, and they give birth to living young, like sharks do.

Here's a model of one of those five babies. And each of them still had a large yolk sac, although the fins are fairly well developed, as you can see. The scales are developed.

NARRATOR: Although fossils had shown tiny coelacanths inside an adult, researchers couldn't tell if the adult was about to give birth, or had eaten the little ones. Now they knew: coelacanths give birth to live young, and have done so for 200 million years. Well before mammals came along, the Coelacanth was using a mammal-like reproductive strategy, insuring that most of its young would survive.

After decades of research, much had been learned. But well into the 1980s, no one had ever observed a Coelacanth alive for more than a few hours.

The Coelacanth lives in deep, cold water where the oxygen content is high. When one is caught and brought to the warmer, less oxygen-rich surface water, it cannot survive very long, especially with the stress of capture. Even today aquariums have been unsuccessful in capturing and keeping a Coelacanth alive.

So no one knew how they mate, how they hunt, how they elude predators in their natural habitat. There was only one way to find out; go to them in a submersible.

HANS FRICKE (Max Planck Institute): It's nothing more than a motorized decompression chamber.

NARRATOR: The man responsible for this chamber is Hans Fricke, a zoologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. He has been obsessed with the Coelacanth since childhood.

HANS FRICKE:	And we thought that the Coelacanths occur deeper than 200 meters, and this was the reason that we built Jago.

NARRATOR: Jago was custom made by its pilot, Jurgen Schauer.

JURGEN SCHAUER (Pilot, Jago Submersible): You have five lights. Each light has a power of 250 watts, so you can impose sunlight on the seabed. And we have five little thrusters. These side ones are rotatable, and we have three in the back for propulsion with which we can make a speed of about walking speed. It's about one mile an hour.

NARRATOR: Jago was brought to the deep blue waters off the Comoros, where, along with biologist Karin Hissman, Fricke and Schauer could pursue the Coelacanth.

One day in 1987, after hunting the fish for weeks to no avail, Fricke was called back to Germany, leaving Jurgen Schauer to continue the ever more frustrating search.

JURGEN SCHAUER: We were already quite desperate already, everybody on the ship.

NARRATOR: Then, at 9 p.m. on the 17th of January, at a depth 600 feet, there it was—a Coelacanth.

JURGEN SCHAUER: We did not know how the fish would behave. Usually the fish swim away when they see the strong light of Jago. But this fish didn't care about the lights.

KARIN HISSMAN (Biologist): It's so large, and it's moving in such a different way than other fish do, which makes it really a spectacular experience to discover a fish like this.

NARRATOR: Schauer immediately radioed Fricke with the exciting news.

HANS FRICKE:	Jurgen called me with the ship radio, and I said to him, "Give everybody a kiss. I give you a bottle of champagne," and so on and so on. I was very, very enthusiastic about it. And on the end of the conversation the operator said, "What the hell is this, what you were talking about?" I said, "the Coelacanth." And he, he asked me, "What is a Coelacanth?" I said, "It's an old, ugly, oily fish."

NARRATOR: As expected, Coelacanths were found to live in a fairly uninhabited ecosystem and seem to have no real predators. They aggregate during the day in volcanic caves, and at night have been known to migrate to depths of over 2,000 feet.

But, unexpectedly, films of the Coelacanth showed how the multiple fins function and laid to rest the idea of a crawling fish, first put forward by J.L.B. Smith.

HANS FRICKE:	Smith said, "Ya, they are creeping on the bottom, like seals." And of course they don't. They are not walking. They are continuously hovering above the ground.

NARRATOR: The Coelacanth moves unlike any other fish of this size. Its oil-filled body allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and float in any position. Six fins are almost constantly in motion like oars in the water: upper and lower fins toward the rear of the creature, plus two pairs of limb-like fins, front and center.

And there was something surprising about the way these limb-like fins moved. Although the Coelacanth was not using them to crawl on the bottom, to the expert eye their motion hinted at walking—walking like we do, according to Susan Jewett, the fish collection manager at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and an international expert in Coelacanth biology.

SUSAN JEWETT (Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History): It's got paired pectoral fins and paired pelvic fins. These are particularly interesting because this fish has what's called a tetrapod form of swimming. We, being tetrapods, have all learned that when we walk, we move the right arm forward in synchrony with the left leg. Well the fish sort of swims like that with that right pectoral and the left pelvic going in synchrony with one another—very interesting characteristics—which again is one of many characteristics that place it in that evolutionary line towards higher vertebrates.

NARRATOR: If the coelacanth swims like a land animal walks, does that, too, suggest it's our closest living relative among the fishes? To this day the evidence is inconclusive. Until recently, most researchers put Coelacanths nearest to tetrapods on an evolutionary tree. But now, a group known as lungfish is thought to be an even closer ancestor, based on new DNA evidence.

We may never know for certain which group of fishes contains our closest living relative. Still, the coelacanth continues to surprise science at every turn.

Six thousand miles from the Comoros, on the other side of the Indian Ocean in Indonesia, the sudden discovery of a Coelacanth would disrupt the lives of two young scientists, an uncanny echo of the events in South Africa some 60 years before. Mark Erdmann, a marine biologist studying coral shrimp, and Arnaz Mehta, a naturalist, had just started a life together as husband and wife, here in Indonesia, when the Coelacanth made its unexpected appearance.

It all began in the local fish market when Mark and Arnaz, stepping out of a taxi, spotted a strange looking fish on a fish cart.

ARNAZ MEHTA (Naturalist): I went over to the cart, and I stared at this fish thinking it was a grouper at first, but then the head was all wrong. Everything was wrong about it. And then I called Mark over, and our other two friends, they came and looked at it. And Mark, sort of in disbelief, said it was a Coelacanth.

MARK ERDMANN (Marine Biologist): It just seemed really kind of incredulous that we could step out of a taxi in a city of over half a million people and see something that was really a big deal go wheeling by on a fish cart.

NARRATOR: They took a photograph but did not purchase the fish, thinking Indonesian Coelacanths were already well known to science. But they soon learned the uniqueness of their sighting: no scientist had ever found a Coelacanth except near South Africa and the Comoros Islands.

Mark and Arnaz quickly embarked on a quest to find a second specimen. Like J.L.B. Smith before them, they enlisted the aid of local fishermen. A new hunt was on for the elusive Coelacanth.

As in the Comoros, this fish was known locally. Fishermen called it "Rajah Laut," "King of the Sea."

SUSAN JEWETT:	Mark wanted to make sure that if one was captured again by these fishermen that he would be able to get it, so he offered a very modest award, uh, reward rather. I think it was perhaps double the market price. And it, it's not a good eating fish, so the market price couldn't have been very high. But it was enough to entice the fishermen to bring it to him when they caught it. And that's exactly what happened.

NARRATOR: Then, ten months after the initial sighting, Mark and Arnaz had a visit.

MARK ERDMANN: And my boatman showed up, and he burst out, "Rajah Laut. Come quick. There's a Coelacanth on the beach."

We rushed down the stairs. Arnaz grabbed the video camera, and we went down to see if this was indeed the fish.

NARRATOR: Like all of its predecessors, the creature soon found life at the surface impossible. But before the great fish died, the couple took it out to deeper water to get photographs in a more natural setting.

Arnaz even had a few moments to swim alongside.

ARNAZ MEHTA:	The fish had been caught several hours earlier and it was really down to its final hour. During that time, you know, her fins were still moving, still flouncing. And then her dorsal fin would raise, and then once in a while she would take a big gulp of water. And she was extremely calm in her inevitable demise.

I couldn't get over how beautiful her scales were. They were, they were, you know, these scales that were speckled with these gold flecks. And it was like a slow dance.

MARK ERDMANN: It was certainly sad to watch such a majestic beast die so slowly.

NARRATOR: When DNA samples of the Indonesian Coelacanth were sequenced, they suggested that this was a new species and dissuaded scientists from the idea that the Indonesian fish was a stray. In fact, from the DNA analysis, it seems that the two populations were separated many million of years ago.

Once again, the mysterious fossil fish surprised scientists around the world.

ROBIN STOBBS:	The Indonesian discovery upset the whole apple cart. Science was all nice and happy, they'd got these little enclaves in the Comoros all sorted out, and anything that was outside that was a stray. Now, all of a sudden, ten thousand kilometers away, right across the other side of the Indian Ocean, we have another colony of Coelacanths. And it's not just one or two, it's not strays, it's a colony. They are known to the Indonesian fishermen, which suggests to me that, that, they're actually more, far more widespread than, than we think.

MARK ERDMANN: That fact, that we could find this animal in a place that is relatively well known to ichthyologists... It would not surprise me in the least if over the next 50 or 100 years that it is revealed that the Coelacanth actually exists pretty much in one continuous population, from the western Indian Ocean all the way up to Indonesia.

NARRATOR: J.L.B. Smith didn't live to hear the story of the Indonesian Coelacanth. In 1968, after years of ill health and in constant pain, Smith took his own life. He was 70 years old.

Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer celebrated her 93rd birthday in February, 2000. She was the first in a long chain of people whose lives were touched by this ancient fish.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: I think that all my life I was called to do what I did in my life. And uh, it all came as a wonderful kind of circle of events, finding this wonderful fish.

SUSAN JEWETT:	There's something about the ancient nature of this fish, and the story that goes with it, that intrigues people so much and pulls them in. It's just something magical about it.

MIKE BRUTON:	I first saw the Coelacanth probably in about 1956, the original mounted specimen in the East London museum. To me, it was this fantastic creature from the past which gave us a window into the past and made us kind of realize life began in the sea. From the sea the vertebrate, the backboned animals, crawled out onto land, and that's where the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates started.

NARRATOR: The final riddle: the Coelacanth may never have stepped onto land, but if this living fossil was able to avoid extinction and detection for so many millions of years, what other strange and wonderful creatures may also be down there?

MARK ERDMANN: It really does say something about how little we know about the oceans. Very definitely that goes a long way in explaining the mystique of the Coelacanth and its enrapturing effect on the public. Because that's kind of a weird thing if you really think about it—it's just a big, ugly, old fish. But there is something more to it, and it's that it's that quality of the unknown, of the deep.

JOE MORTON: The clear blue waters and rolling surf of the California coast are a playground in the sun. They're also the hunting ground of one of the world's most dangerous creatures: the great white shark. Encounters between sharks and surfers are rare, but unforgettable. They strike with no warning and little chance of escape.

KIRK JOHNSON: When it first hit me, it was such a hard blow. I mean it really hit hard.

JOE MORTON: Held in the jaws of a fifteen foot shark, Kirk Johnson thought it was the end. He felt his body shaken violently. But as quickly as it began, the attack was over.

KIRK JOHNSON: And the shark then just let go of me. And I came to the surface. And the water was turning all dark around me with blood.

JOE MORTON: His back torn open, Johnson was barely able to get to shore. Why did the shark attack, and then suddenly release him? Surfer John Ferrara has asked the same question. While paddling his board, Ferrara was hit by an immense force.

JOHN FERRARA: I describe it as about the size of a Volkswagen, the body of it, just the girth. And the fin of it was about three feet out of the water while it was just going past me very slowly. And you pretty much know exactly what it is, it's something wanting to eat you, you know? And you want to get the hell out of there.

JOE MORTON: But if the shark had wanted to eat John Ferrara, why didn't it? Like most surfers who are attacked, both men escaped, and returned to the water as soon as they could. Some believe surfers are tempting fate, but is the great white shark really a man hunter? The elusiveness of these sharks has shrouded them in mystery. Yet new research sheds light on why attacks happen. As science replaces sensationalism, these sharks may lose their reputation as monsters of the deep. To understand sharks, researchers must delve into their domain. The Farallon Islands lie just twenty miles off the coast of California, west of San Francisco. In Native American legend, their sinister, jagged peaks were said to be the islands of the dead. The Farallons are also a regular feeding area of the great white shark. There are few places in the world where great whites can be so closely observed in the act of killing. Their prey are usually marine mammals, like these California sea lions. Some members of this group have had narrow escapes. But they are not the only animals facing danger. In the Fall, the presence of northern elephant seals ushers in the hunting season. It's a busy time for biologists like Peter Pyle, who spends much of the year studying birds. Now he turns to pinnipeds, seals and sea lions, and the sharks that prey on them. California sea lions haul out here to rest throughout the year, safe on the shore, but often enduring plagues of flies. In the autumn, they are joined by juvenile elephant seals coming ashore for the first time in months. The seasonal concentration of young, naive seals draws white sharks like a magnet. Hauling out on this rocky ledge is a struggle, especially at high tide. Huge waves can wash the seals right back into the surf. Just a few feet off shore, the sharks are waiting for them. And Peter Pyle is waiting for the sharks.

PETER PYLE: The shark is a visual predator, the White Shark here, more than anything. It stalks in the depths, probably behind ridges, against the rocks, where the pinnipeds are going to have a harder time seeing it. And then, when the time is right, it will rush up from below and strike the pinniped at the surface.

JOE MORTON: Stealth and surprise are critical elements in a successful attack. The blood slick and agitated gulls draw the attention of the Farallon researchers waiting at a vantage point high on the island. To understand more about where and how sharks attack, the researchers need to pinpoint the location. They will later visit this site to check the water depth and clarity and whether the kill takes place over rock or a sandy bottom. But now, they want to observe the feeding while it's happening. Pyle hurries to the boat landing. There, he joins shark biologist, Scot Anderson. If it's a big seal, it may take the shark half an hour to eat it. This gives the team time to get on the water and alongside the kill. Rough seas make their job difficult; their boat is only fourteen feet long.

PETER PYLE: The first couple of times we went out in boats, we approached it very cautiously, we circled in, we kept our distance, we looked from a distance, we took pictures from a distance. And then slowly, we realized that the sharks would come up to the boat, but they didn't have any real intention on doing anything, they were more or less just checking us out.

SCOT ANDERSON: It's very exciting to see a shark in the water. These sharks are huge, you know? We're talking fifteen to eighteen feet with a weight of maybe three to four thousand pounds. And they have an amazing presence in the water. As they move through the area, they're very controlled. They know where they're going before they get there, and so you just are kind of in awe of this silent, huge predator moving through the water.

JOE MORTON: At the attack site, the two men lower underwater cameras beside the boat. Other sharks may move in to get a bite of the prey, but if the killer is a big animal, they stay away. Scars on their skin suggest great whites may at times turn on one another.

PETER PYLE: We're out there getting as much video as we can on these sharks, and a lot of them have scars of various types. Some of them look like aggressive scars where maybe one shark has come in and bitten another to kind of warn it away from the carcass. A lot of the females seem to have scars along the gills which may relate to mating scars. And these scars are pretty permanent. They look white at first, and then they turn black. And after a while, we'll mark down all the spots where these scars are, and we'll be able to use those in our individual I.D.

JOE MORTON: Scot Anderson has identified more than forty white sharks here. Many return time and again. After the initial violent attack, sharks feed in a controlled, almost calm manner, contrary to the notion of a feeding frenzy. A shark can consume a four hundred pound meal in ten immense bites of up to fifty pounds each. The Farallon researchers are accustomed to sharing these waters with feeding sharks. They witness up to seventy attacks each season. Still, working in a boat that is smaller than the sharks that surround it takes courage.

PETER PYLE: It's always a thrill when you've got white sharks circling around below you. I don't think we'll ever get over that thrill. They're looking at us, they're curious. It's interesting in that the biggest ones seem to be the smartest about it and know sooner that we're not edible and disappear quicker. It's actually the little ones that we're a little more worried about, maybe the nine to twelve footers that we see here, because they're less experienced. We don't know what they're going to do, they're less predictable, as far as I'm concerned. They're the ones that may end up getting a little excited near the boat. I think they're also the ones that might be hitting surfers more.

JOE MORTON: Surfers are more vulnerable to great white sharks than anyone else in the water. As they skim the surface of the waves, underneath them, sharks may be lurking. But their presence here may have little to do with seeking human prey. Many of the best surfing beaches are near the breeding colonies of seals and sea lions. In fifty years, there have been fewer than eighty attacks on humans in California, only seven fatal. With so many people in the water, it's surprising there haven't been more. Perhaps the attacks that do take place are cases of mistaken identity. A surfer paddling out to sea, arms waving and feet trailing, may look like a seal. But even if they look like the favorite food of great whites, surfers don't taste the same. Compared to an elephant seal, a human body must seem bony. The scars on animals here at Ano Nuevo, south of the Farallons, testify to their shark encounters. Seals and sea lions have been the prey of large sharks for some thirty-five million years. Ferocious as these male elephant seals may be, they are no match for sharks. As females look on, bulls, over three times their weight, fight for mating rights. Protection of breeding colonies, like this one, has brought seal populations back from the edge of extinction. Forty years ago, this beach was barren, now it is home to over ten thousand animals. It is literally a pup factory. But as soon as these babies are weaned, they will have to leave the beach and start to feed themselves. It will be months before they see land again. Many of those feeding contentedly at their mother's sides will find themselves in the shark-infested waters of the Farallon Islands, seeking shelter on the wave-swept rocks. It happens every Fall, and the biologists will be waiting. Scot Anderson has studied great whites for nearly ten years and has a down-to-earth view of the drama between predator and prey.

SCOT ANDERSON: The great white shark is an apex predator that feeds on marine mammals. When they're young, they feed on fish, as they grow older, they begin feeding on strictly marine mammals. And that puts them at the top of the food chain. The elephant seal is considered to be their preferred prey at the Farallons in that they're solitary animals, they're easy to capture because they're slow swimmers and they tend to be naive when they're young and they sit at the surface, which they shouldn't do.

JOE MORTON: As it patrols beneath the waves, a shark can see the silhouettes of prey above. Great whites cruise sixty to one hundred feet under water, close enough to maintain eye contact, yet far enough to ensure stealth. Sea lions are attacked far less often than elephant seals, perhaps because they travel in groups, with more pairs of eyes on the look-out for danger. These warm-blooded mammals are swift and agile, and difficult for sharks to catch. The great white's hydrodynamic design is adapted more for cruising than sustained sprints. But it is equipped for short high-speed dashes, propelled by an awesomely powerful tail. The slow-moving elephant seal doesn't stand a chance. The shark rushes up from the bottom in an ambush attack. A lethal first bite insures the seal can't fight back. The seal dies quickly from loss of blood, while the shark thrashes its head back and forth, cutting through muscle, bone and blubber. It's a bite that requires the powerful jaw of an adult great white, as biologist Ken Goldman explains.

KEN GOLDMAN: This is a jaw out of a six foot animal, definitely a juvenile white shark. And two things to really notice are the narrowness of the teeth, and nice spiky, pointy teeth, as well as at the top, the teeth are also fairly narrow, fairly strong, spiky teeth. Perfect for feeding on fish, very similar to other shark's teeth that are specifically designed to feed on fish. As they get older, and move to feeding on the seals and sea lions, the bottom teeth broaden out at the base, flatten out across here, designed more to grab a hold of the prey. And so you never want to grab a hold of anything that would be able to get out of your mouth, so the teeth are pointed back in, giving grip. The top teeth then come down and are removing that bite.

JOE MORTON: The infamous jaws of the great white shark are remarkable in other ways. Its upper jaw is not firmly joined to the skull, but can jut forward to clamp down on prey. And the shark has a seemingly endless supply of fresh, sharp teeth. When front teeth are damaged, back ones move forward to replace them. A shark may grow and discard thousands of teeth in its lifetime. Great Whites may live up to seventy years, but this, like much about the shark, is still uncertain. They have been captured, but never successfully kept in captivity. Their movement and behavior in the wild is now better understood thanks to remote tracking.

KEN GOLDMAN: Well the tracking of sharks out at the Farallons consists of feeding a shark one of these. This is a sonic transmitter, and it relays temperature and swimming depth of the animal to me. So, when a shark has attacked a seal, we'll go out in the boat and put this in the water with a small piece of seal or sea lion blubber, and when the shark ingests this, we're able to start tracking immediately. It's done within the natural predatory sequence.

JOE MORTON: Goldman finds that large individuals tend to feed in the same place each year, patrolling areas where they have been successful before. Younger, less experienced sharks, move around the islands looking for chance encounters with prey. The transmitters also show that the body temperature of great white sharks is much higher than that of the surrounding water, and, like warm-blooded mammals, the shark maintains a constant internal temperature.

KEN GOLDMAN: It's probably a very effective evolved mechanism for these animals. This is an animal that is an active hunter in very cool water conditions, and it's hunting a very swift and agile prey. So, my hypothesis is that if the animal was not regulating its body core temperature being much higher than water temperature, it would probably not be an effective hunter.

JOE MORTON: Being warm-blooded also helps the shark to digest blubber, a very rich source of energy. And no prey offers more blubber than a whale. The great whales, like these humpbacks, may have once been important to the shark's diet. Now, these whales are scarce, and to find a carcass washed up on a beach is a rare treat for a foraging shark. If there is one to be found, the shark's acute sense of smell will detect it, even from miles away. This humpback whale will provide a huge meal, hundreds of pounds of blubber. The challenge for the shark is to find the proper angle to take a bite out of the massive carcass. A meal like this can sustain a great white for over a month. But scavenging whales is not a reliable source of food. A large predator must have easy access to living prey, as the great white shark has at the Farallons. In these rough waters where seals abound, Scot Anderson has devised a way to get a whole new view of a shark attack. He attaches a video camera to a board. Research shows that this particular shape will provoke great whites. Scot and Peter Pyle motor out to a place they know is teaming with sharks and float the board in the water. Remarkably, no animal bait is needed to attract the sharks. They are drawn simply by the shape of the board, oblong and roughly six feet in length, the shape of a seal, a sea lion, or a floating surfer. Sometimes, the sharks merely investigate the board and swim by. But at other times, they stalk and attack. Following the initial strike, the sharks may hover momentarily, but they rarely return for a second bite. They know a good thing when they taste it, and this isn't it. The fierceness of this attack startles even the most unflappable scientist.

SCOT ANDERSON: Well last year I was scared by a shark that came up to investigate the board that I had out when it was really close to the boat, actually bringing it in to the boat, about a foot away, and when the shark attacked it, it went violently through the area. Incredibly quick, incredibly loud, and it really scared me. So it made me realize that there's certain times when dealing with these animals where there is some danger. But most of the time, when they're around the boat, they're very controlled, they're looking for food, and it usually is, seems pretty safe to me for the most part.

JOE MORTON: It's safe, for the most part, for other people working near the Farallons, abalone fishermen collecting highly prized shellfish. Climbing into waters inhabited by great whites may seem a questionable practice. But even here, the risk of attack is slim. Ninety percent of shark attacks take place at the surface, most others in mid-water. On the sea floor, divers are relatively safe. But diving with open wounds or holding fish and other bait is asking for trouble. The divers must keep a sharp lookout for cruising great whites, as they measure the abalone to make sure they meet legal standards. Rod Orr holds the dubious distinction of having been attacked twice in pursuit of abalone.

ROD ORR: Just at the edge of vision I saw something, but I didn't realize what it was, and then the little light dawned, and what I could see was the gills on this white shark. And the shark was like ten, eleven foot long, and it closed on me, but when I looked back at it, it had closed the distance by half, and then it started coming in fast. And I knew it was after me. But I tried to get behind this rock. And when I tried to get behind it, the shark came in on my left side, his mouth just opened up, and his jaw actually just came out of his mouth. And I had a row of teeth marks up in my scalp where he bit down. And the worst damage was probably to my nose and to my lower eye, because I had a hole through the upper eyelid and the bottom eyelid. All I could see was really, was the teeth out of my, you know, from my left eye, I could see the water down there. And I could see all the teeth on the top jaw and the bottom jaw. But I was face down in it, and it was just like, they looked huge, they looked like they were three inches long. I know they weren't that big, but they were just all white. And I could see about ten or twelve teeth. I think he realized that I wasn't a seal at that time, but why he didn't finish biting the head off me, why he didn't thrash I don't know. It's just luck of the draw.

JOE MORTON: Why did the shark release him? Most likely, a bony human didn't seem a worthwhile meal. But there are sharks in other parts of the world with less discriminating tastes. Perhaps these predators are even more to be feared. In tropical waters throughout the world, including here in Hawaii, there lives a shark responsible for more attacks on humans than even the great white. In a place of golden beaches where surfing is a way of life, more people are exposed to danger. These clear and inviting waters are also home to the tiger shark. As the largest shark on most Pacific reefs, tigers rule as apex predators, feeding on fish and lobsters, seals and turtles, rays and other sharks. They are said to eat just about anything that comes their way: floating license plates, garbage from ships, even humans. Hawaiian culture has a special word for sharks that eat people: niuhi. They are animals both feared and respected. Local surfers today reassure themselves in different ways about the dangers of shark-infested waters.

SURFER: Oh, I'm not worried about the tiger shark because I feel like that's my aumakua, which mean it's, it's a religious belief that native Hawaiians have about the sharks.

SURFER: It depends, if there's a lot of people around, I don't worry about it too much, because the odds of getting eaten is probably a little less. But when you go surfing in other secret spots and stuff, that's when you're always like looking down and checking it out.

SURFER: If you were to go surfing, go snorkeling when it's flat, you'd see a million turtles, and that's what the tiger sharks eat.

JOE MORTON: Green turtles are common in the tiger shark's diet. Whole shells have been found in their stomachs. But is it possible that tiger sharks could unintentionally attack surfers, mistaking them for turtles? David Silva thinks they might.

DAVID SILVA: We're out on the east side of the island of Kauai, on this beach called Wailua Beach. I got an attack off this point here, about seventy-five yards out from shore. To me, I think he thought that I was a turtle because my board is yellow, and with my hands paddling in the water, it makes me more look like a turtle. So I think he thought that I was a turtle, and he came for me.

JOE MORTON: David Silva was lucky. Other surfers have died in recent years from tiger shark attacks. He was badly hurt, but able to paddle his board safely to shore. For years, it was rare for a surfer to see a green turtle in the wild. Over-fishing had depleted their numbers, and their nesting beaches were destroyed by tourism. Today, surfers see turtles more often. But with some trepidation. It's widely believed that more turtles mean more shark attacks on people. The divers most accustomed to swimming with sea turtles are the marine biologists who monitor their survival in these waters. While the turtle population is rising, it is still at risk. The turtles are remarkably unwary of the scuba divers in their midst. On the sandy bottom, a mile off Honolulu, the scientists can catch the turtles by hand. The turtles are taken temporarily to a nearby boat for a physical exam. George Balazs is a research biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Honolulu. He is not convinced of any link between turtles and sharks.

GEORGE BALAZS: Our research program started in 1972, twenty-two years ago. We have specifically gone to places in Hawaii that are the best sites for turtles, and in all those years of diving, we have never once, I have never once, encountered or even seen a tiger shark. One would think that if I am exposing myself to higher risk being with the turtles, that I would have at least seen one, and such has not been the case.

JOE MORTON: Balazs also doubts that tiger sharks mistake surfers for turtles.

GEORGE BALAZS: I think anybody that's in the ocean should have a healthy fear of sharks, but to think that they look like a turtle, I think there's no basis for it whatsoever. Any object in the water at or near the surface could be liable to be snapped at by a shark. You don't have to look like a turtle in order to be eaten by a predator.

JOE MORTON: So, if it's not a case of mistaken identity, are tiger sharks actively seeking human prey? The rate of attacks in Hawaii remains steady at about two per year, while the number of people in the water has sky rocketed. Biologist, Steve Kaiser believes this is proof enough.

STEVE KAISER: People aren't prey items for sharks. I mean you can look, these are what, potential victims here? No, you know, if people were being eaten by sharks all the time, if they were a natural prey item, we'd be getting ten attacks an hour. When you look at these people in the water, we are clumsy, we're awkward. Sharks are in their element and we're not. They would be taking these guys every minute of the day. I mean we are like fatted calves waiting to be slaughtered out there.

JOE MORTON: While rare, any shark attack can spur panic. In 1991, the state was shaken by the first confirmed fatality in three decades. The story led the news.

REPORTER: The waters off Olowalu, south of Lahaina, are normally calm. And forty-one-year-old, Martha Merrell, swam often near her beach front home. She had no warning that on the morning of November 26th, 1991, she would be killed by what was believed to be a fifteen foot tiger shark.

JOE MORTON: In the months that followed, there was a rash of five more attacks, two of them fatal.

REPORTER: His body board was found with a huge bite out of it—

JOE MORTON: With each attack, the outcry mounted.

REPORTER: After the attack, city and state officials closed beaches from Makawao to Makahuena until an effort can be made to find the killer shark.

JOE MORTON: Under pressure from the tourist industry, the state of Hawaii set up a task force to deal with the attacks. It went beyond closing beaches, they killed any tiger shark found in the area.

BRUCE CARLSON: Well as soon as people started, there were shark attacks that were happening and a few people were killed by sharks, there's a huge public outcry to do something about this situation.

JOE MORTON: After each attack, the state set fishing lines in the area. The goal was to hunt down the shark responsible for the terrifying incident. They carefully examined each carcass. But no human remains or other incriminating evidence were ever found.

BRUCE CARLSON: We were making a decision, if we're going to do any fishing, we're going to try and do it to make sure that we got the fish that actually was the cause of the attack. Otherwise, I don't think as biologists we'd just go out and randomly kill sharks to appease public opinion. It was our best guess that if we went within twenty-four hours, we might catch the shark that did it. We also know we need a lot more research to know about the biology of these animals to know what are the chances of actually catching that animal within twenty-four hours. Will it be there? Or won't it?

JOE MORTON: The State of Hawaii caught and killed eleven tiger sharks in all. Private fishermen thought it wasn't enough. They killed forty-four in a single year.

PERRY DANE: Every time there's an attack, the state takes out one or two sharks and they call it quits. So I want to just keep a consistent basis of bringing out sharks. If I can make a few bucks on it, hey. If fishing's slow, catch sharks, why not? If I'm not going to do it, who's going to do it?

JOE MORTON: The hunts calmed the public, but they also stirred controversy. Was the slaughter of these animals necessary? How many sharks would have to die to protect the beaches of Hawaii? To answer these questions, the state funded new research on tiger sharks. The principle investigator is Dr. Kim Holland of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.

KIM HOLLAND: We don't know if the same fish come back to the same area day after day. We don't know if they have a home range that they patrol on a daily basis, or a weekly basis. We don't know if, what the size of that home range is, if there is one. We don't know if in fact there's just a continuous stream of new sharks coming past any given point on the shore line. And until you know those kinds of things about their movement patterns, any control mechanisms, or any control programs you might want to put in place, won't have any scientific direction to them.

JOE MORTON: This female tiger shark has been hooked on a line designed to inflict little injury. She is alive and well. But in a natural trance-like state. Merely flipping the shark on her back has induced this state, commonly called animal hypnosis. The shark makes no movement as Holland performs minor surgery, inserting a seven inch sonic transmitter into her belly. The transmitter has been coated with natural waxes to prevent an immune response. As soon as she is turned over, the shark snaps back to life, thrashing and struggling to break free. But first, someone has to take the hook out of her mouth.

KIM HOLLAND: One of the things we're finding is that these sharks have no qualms about going off-shore into deep blue water. One of the preconceptions was that these animals were coastal. This isn't the case at all.

JOE MORTON: This study is the first to track tiger sharks in the wild. The scientists drop an underwater antenna to listen for signals from the transmitter. It picks up signals from up to a mile away. The ship will stay on the trail for as long as the fuel, and the team's stamina, hold out, usually for forty-eight hours.

KIM HOLLAND: Well, as often is the case when you finally get the chance to see an animal or observe an animal in its own environment, you get surprises, things you didn't anticipate.

JOE MORTON: The common notion that tiger sharks patrol a small coastal area, that each shark has its own personal territory, is soon overturned. Instead, the researchers find the sharks travel great distances from island to island and dive as deep as a thousand feet.

KIM HOLLAND: We had no idea that these fish had this ability to go so deep so easily without apparently any restrictions on their movement patterns. So again, these are the kind of things that you can't find out without observing the animal in its own environment. And this is the first chance that we've had to do that with tiger sharks.

JOE MORTON: So far, Holland and his team have tagged over eighty tigers, from thousand-pound adults to sixty pound juveniles. Their work is the most extensive to date on the movement patterns of any large shark. Sometimes the researchers encounter and follow the same shark weeks or months after the initial track. The sonic transmitters last for about a year, which allows the team to look at whether tiger sharks return time and again to a specific location. At the spot where a tiger shark is originally caught, an underwater instrument is moored to the ocean floor. It serves as a listening post and records when and how often sharks revisit the site of their capture. Divers later retrieve the information which shows that sharks do return, and suggests that they may have home ranges. But the time between visits extends anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Holland's tiger shark research, together with the countless hours he has spent with these animals, convince him that the sharks may have more to fear from human hunters than humans have to fear from them.

KIM HOLLAND: Well, one of the things we are finding in our research is it's not hard to catch tiger sharks. There's a lot of tiger sharks out there and there always has been. There also is a lot of people in the water in Hawaii, and they're very close together spatially. But we have very, very few shark attacks, maybe less than two per year, state wide. These sharks are not careless about what they do. People are not a normal part of their diet, even if they were just biting anything that was more or less in the right place at the right time, we would have dozens of attacks on people in a month. But we don't. And this indicates to me that these sharks are not careless. They are very specific about what they eat and people are not one of those things.

JOE MORTON: In the effort to prevent shark attacks, Holland's work holds an important lesson. Attempts to hunt down specific killer sharks may be in vain, because tiger sharks range so widely. The shark responsible is likely long gone and any sharks killed will probably be replaced by others. A single hunting shark can cover a huge area, from Oahu, for example, to a group of sand atolls five hundred miles away. This pristine underwater wilderness is rich with marine life, the area, part of the northwestern islands of Hawaii, is a wildlife preserve where commercial fishing is outlawed. Surrounded by shallow water teaming with fish, the islands are ideal for seabirds. More than fourteen million birds of fifteen different species migrate here to nest. And tiger sharks come the same time each year to prey on the offspring. Albatross chicks are the primary target. These babies will grow rapidly on a diet of regurgitated fish. By mid-June, they will be fed less and less often. Soon, their parents will leave the island, and the chicks will be on their own. Each morning, when the wind rises, they face into it and exercise their flying muscles. There is one last feeding and then the fledglings will have to find their own fish. They make their way into the water and face the dangers that await them. All around them, dark shadows move beneath the surface. Catching winged prey is a test of a great hunter's prowess. The first fledglings to venture from their nests stay close to the shore. The sharks are hungry, but they must maneuver in water only a few feet deep. Over the first few days, the sharks find it difficult to come to grips with their prey. They're out of practice. They haven't tried to catch albatross chicks since this time last year. The chick fights back, pecking at its tormentor, instinctively aiming for the shark's most vulnerable spot, its eyes. The tiger has a natural defense, a lower eye lid that closes as the shark lunges forward toward its prey. During these first few critical days, some chicks learn to fly in time to escape. But the tiger sharks cruising these waters have other options. The northwestern islands are the breeding ground of the Hawaiian monk seal, an endangered species rare around the main islands. There are only about fourteen hundred of them. For tigers, as for great whites, marine mammals are a source of energy-rich blubber. Some of these seals have bite scars and missing flippers and keep a sharp look out for sharks. But at this time of year, the tigers may be less interested in seals than usual. For days on end, albatross chicks have been testing their skills on the open beach where the breeze is strongest. Once on the wing, they might not return to the islands for three years, if they survive that long. The sharks have also been practicing. They now know that they must reach high out of the water to be sure of catching the bird. If it misses on the first strike, the shark turns and follows the chick upwind. Eventually, the young muscles tire, and the bird is trapped. About one in ten chicks falls victim to sharks each year. More die of starvation or drown in the surf. In a matter of weeks, the birds are gone, and the tiger sharks swim off as well to seek better hunting grounds elsewhere. Legend says it is folly to play in the surf around sunrise or sunset, that this is the time when sharks come to feed. Like other folklore, this belief is being overturned. Tiger sharks may be in these waters at all times, but they are not here to hunt humans. If sharks were man-hunters, surfing would be suicide. These animals are powerful, adaptable hunters, occupying their rightful place in the ocean. It is up to us to stay out of their way.

NARRATOR: As World War II comes to an end, scientists discover the secret of the atom, unleashing death and destruction on an unimaginable scale. Now they are racing to discover the secret of life.

It will be the find of the century. It's May 1, 1952, and what these scientists gathered at the Royal Society don't know is, at this very moment, close by in a London lab, an X-ray camera is clicking off a 100-hour exposure of something called "DNA."

When developed, this photograph will reveal the structure of DNA and the key to understanding how the blueprint for all life on earth is passed down from generation to generation.

Two of the most determined of the DNA detectives are Francis Crick and an American, James Watson. Also at the Royal Society is a 31 year-old British scientist named Rosalind Franklin. She is responsible for the crucial X-ray photo.

As Watson, Crick and their colleague Maurice Wilkins, strive to solve the puzzle of DNA, Franklin's work will pave the way. Without her knowledge, they will gain access to her findings and her remarkable X-ray image of DNA. It will lead to one of the greatest discoveries in science, and, some believe, to one of its greatest injustices.

NARRATOR: In 1962, a Nobel Prize is awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for their groundbreaking work on DNA. It is one of the greatest achievements in the history of science, often described as the key to unlocking the secret of life.

A few years later, James Watson publishes his personal account of the discovery. In The Double Helix, this slim, best-selling book, he depicts a race to determine the structure of DNA and introduces a little-known scientist named Rosalind Franklin.

BRENDA MADDOX (Author, Rosalind Franklin): I don't think anybody would have heard of Rosalind Franklin. I certainly wouldn't have written the book unless James Watson, in 1968, had written The Double Helix. But in it there is this character, the terrible Rosy, this bad tempered, bluestocking who hoarded her data, who wouldn't let the men see it, you know, and lashed out at all of them. They were all terrified of her, and it really makes the whole story go.

NARRATOR: Watson's casting of Franklin as villain works as a literary device, but who she is in his book and who she was in real life are quite different. And unfortunately, Franklin wasn't around to defend herself. She died at the age of 37, a decade before The Double Helix was published and became a best seller.

BRENDA MADDOX: When The Double Helix was in rough draft, Harvard University Press, which was planning to publish it, asked that all those so candidly mentioned be given a chance to read it. And they did. And Wilkins and Crick above all, but not only, objected most strongly.

NARRATOR: As Francis Crick wrote to Watson, "Your book is misleading and in bad taste. It does not illuminate the process of scientific discovery, it distorts it."

Maurice Wilkins complained that the book was, "unfair to almost everyone mentioned except Professor Watson himself." And, referring to Rosalind Franklin, he asks Watson "Is there any mention in your book that she died?"

MAURICE WILKINS (King's College London): Well that was what the main thing in objecting to Jim's book was...it...what it said of Rosalind. There was all this silly natter about the wrong clothing or something. I thought this pretty inane and not true. I mean she was, to say the least, a very presentable person.

NARRATOR: Who was the real Rosalind Franklin? And what is her contribution to one of the greatest breakthroughs in science?

Rosalind Franklin was born in London in 1920, into a family that achieved wealth through banking and publishing. They had a proud tradition of scholarship, philanthropy and involvement in social causes.

BRENDA MADDOX: The Franklin family was one of a very select group of English Jews who came to England during the 18th century. They became very wealthy, a very close network, very English in their manner, more English than the English.

NARRATOR: From an early age, Rosalind stands out. She enjoys memory games, and an aunt writes, "Rosalind is alarmingly clever. She spends all her time doing arithmetic for pleasure, and invariably gets her sums right."

Her parents send her to St. Paul's Girls' School, which, despite its name, had no church affiliation. What it did have was a strong tradition of preparing girls for a career.

Sue Richley and Anne Piper attended St. Paul's and were Rosalind Franklin's lifelong friends.

ANNE PIPER (Lifelong friend of Rosalind Franklin): She was the best at science, she was the best at math, and she was just one of the best in that year...the best, I would say, in that year. She played in the teams...

SUE RICHLEY (Lifelong friend of Rosalind Franklin): Tennis, hockey, lacrosse, football, cricket...

ANNE PIPER:	Yes, she combined using her mind play with having a certain natural ability.

SUE RICHLEY:	She always expected...and if she undertook something, she would be running it. She wished to be, expected it to be like that.

NARRATOR: While Rosalind excels academically, the outside world is encroaching. The Nazis are on the march. As Jewish refugees flee the Nazi onslaught, the Franklins are active in finding safe haven in England for those who manage to escape.

Rosalind is anxious to do something useful with her life. She finishes a year early at St. Paul's and wins a scholarship to study physics and chemistry at Cambridge University.

BRENDA MADDOX: In 1938, Rosalind arrives here at Newnham College, one of the women's colleges of Cambridge University. In her classes she's introduced to the new subject of X-ray crystallography.

NARRATOR: This technique can reveal the hidden atomic structure of matter in its crystalline form. Atoms are too small to see under light microscopes, so crystallographers shoot invisible X-rays at them, which then bounce off, or diffract, onto a detector, such as film.

By applying math to the diffraction pattern, it's possible to calculate the three-dimensional form of even the most complex molecules.

BRENDA MADDOX: In her X-ray diffraction work, Rosalind joins the small band of the human race for whom tiny specks of matter are as real as billiard balls.

NARRATOR: In 1939, as Franklin steps into the world of science, Cambridge University appoints its first female professor, and Britain prepares for the German invasion.

By the time she graduates, Franklin is determined to contribute to the war effort. Her father pressures her to carry on the family's charitable tradition. She replies that she would be of little use in anything but science. When he accuses her of making science her religion, she writes, "In my view, all that is necessary for faith is the belief that by doing our best we shall succeed in our aims: the improvement of mankind."

BRENDA MADDOX: Cambridge really did for Rosalind everything that a good university should. It gave her a profession, a philosophy of life. It enabled her to distance herself from her parents. She emerged a mature, socially and politically aware individual, and she was ready to become a working scientist.

NARRATOR: She joined the war effort doing research on coal. Her experiments led to a better gas mask, a valuable contribution to England under attack. She published five landmark papers, still cited today, and she was awarded her Ph.D.

When the war was over, her experience earned her the job offer of her dreams, a research position in one of the best labs in Paris. One of her closest colleagues and friends at the Laboratoire is Vittorio Luzatti, here, in a restaurant that Rosalind enjoyed.

VITTORIO LUZZATI (CNRS): She loved Paris, she loved life in Paris. That was quite clear. She was very happy here.

NARRATOR: She took a flat on a little street behind the Church of St. Sulpice in the 6th arrondissement. She wore the latest in Paris fashion, Dior's "New Look" for the new woman. She shopped in the fresh air markets and took great pleasure cooking for her friends.

She walked to work along the Seine, passing in the shadow of Notre Dame, to the Laboratoire Central, at 12 Quai Henri IV. It was here, in a collegial atmosphere, that Franklin perfected her techniques of X-ray diffraction.

LYNN OSMAN ELKIN (California State University, Hayward): She had just a feeling for the work, for experimental work. She loved it. She loved being in the laboratory. And a lot of people who are very, very good scientists—and even very good experimental scientists—view that as drudgery that they have to get through to get an answer, whereas she actually loved the process of science.

NARRATOR: Franklin was gaining an international reputation, speaking at conferences and publishing in professional journals. An avid hiker, she took trips with colleagues to Norway, Wales and the Alps.

Her research was not without its risks. Lab workers were periodically checked for overexposure to X-rays, and when Franklin exceeded safe levels, she was upset that she had to stay away from the lab for a few weeks.

After four years in Paris, she faced a decision. Should she stay in France or return home to England? She asked the advice of Dorothy Hodgkin, a renowned crystallographer and one of only ten women to win a Nobel Prize.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: And it was Dorothy's advice that it was time for her to make up her mind, and if she decided to have her scientific life in England, she should go back. And she left reluctantly. She was not very happy to leave Paris. I think that the decision she had to make...I think it was, to some extent, a cruel one.

NARRATOR: Franklin is offered a position at King's College in London, a highly prestigious research center. She is hired by J. T. Randall, the director of the biophysics labs, to create an X-ray diffraction unit to investigate the structure of proteins. She accepts the offer, but writes to a friend, "To change the banks of the Seine for a cellar on the Strand seems to me quite insane."

But as she is leaving Paris, she receives a letter from Randall, shifting her focus from proteins to the little understood substance, called DNA. Rosalind Franklin is 30 years old as she unwittingly enters an undeclared race to unravel the secret of life.

KIMBERLY MOWRY (Brown University): So this is DNA. It's really beautiful and amazing stuff. It's responsible for heredity; it's the genetic material. Some would argue that it's the blueprint for every cell in your body. But at the time when Rosalind Franklin started working on DNA, it wasn't at all clear what DNA really looked like or how it might work.

NARRATOR: In 1943, after a decade of work, Oswald Avery and his team at Rockefeller University transferred DNA from a disease-causing strain of bacteria into a harmless strain. The harmless strain turned virulent, strongly suggesting a link between DNA and heredity.

KIMBERLY MOWRY: Avery's experiments showed that genetic characteristics of one organism could be transferred to another. And he showed that DNA was the vehicle of that transformation, that DNA was the genetic material. But that conclusion was by no means universally accepted.

NARRATOR: DNA was thought to consist of sugar and phosphates in long chains of some unknown shape. It also appeared to have just four other chemical ingredients, called bases. But how could such a simple molecule be responsible for the diversity of all life on Earth? Some believed that discovering the structure of DNA would lead to an answer. That was Franklin's assignment when she arrived at King's College London, in January, 1951.

Now a Professor at King's, Raymond Gosling was a Ph.D. student in biophysics, at the time of Franklin's arrival.

RAYMOND GOSLING (King's College London): When I first came in '49, '50, what there was, was a bomb crater, remains of the second World War. We had to walk around the bomb crater and in here to the main hall of the college.

Now, our physics department was down that end of this corridor. Right at the end was the lab that Rosalind and I did the X-ray diffraction in. Yes, yes, now this is quite close to what it was actually like. This is about the size of the room, and as you see it's right in the basement, so that gives you a sort of taste to the bowels-of-the-earth type of environment in which the early work was done.

NARRATOR: Despite the war-ravaged facilities, King's College was the place to be for DNA research.

RAYMOND GOSLING: Maurice Wilkins had his office just through these doors in those days.

NARRATOR: Maurice Wilkins, a physicist fresh from the Manhattan Project, took some of the first X-ray diffraction images of DNA here. He had to improvise at every step to cope with the lab's antiquated technology.

RAYMOND GOSLING: Maurice came over and had a look at what I was doing, and we decided that, of course, that this was a dreadful leaky object. And he thought for a bit, then took a condom out of his pocket and said, "Here you are, my boy. Poke the collimator through that." And so we did.

NARRATOR: Franklin quickly adjusted to the physical limitations of the lab, but not to the segregated boys' club culture of King's College.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: She was not happy in King's College. And all that she told us about it was almost incredible. I mean, the fact that they had a common room, a lunch place, which was forbidden to women, I mean it sounded unheard...I mean it was absurd to us. It was not the kind of life you would like to have anywhere, to be forbidden a place because you are a dog, a woman or a Jew.

NARRATOR: To make matters worse, there was confusion over who was in charge, Franklin or Maurice Wilkins. At the time of her arrival, Wilkins was on holiday. While he was gone, his Ph.D. student, Raymond Gosling, was put under Franklin's supervision.

When Wilkins returned, he walked into a vastly improved lab, but it wasn't his anymore. He lost his lab and his Ph.D. student. And Rosalind Franklin, whom he thought was going to be his assistant, turned out to be better trained and already working independently. When he checked in on her progress, he was rebuffed.

MAURICE WILKINS: And she just said, "Go back to your microscopes," which bewildered me. What the hell is she on about? So, we had a very stressful aspect, which did not help the joint work in our laboratory, as a result.

NARRATOR: The stressful relationship between Wilkins and Franklin arose from a miscommunication that originated with the director of the lab, J. T. Randall.

SIR AARON KLUG (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology: Here we have copies of Rosalind Franklin's working notebooks.

NARRATOR: Sir Aaron Klug, Nobel Prize winner and former president of the Royal Society, was Franklin's last collaborator. After her death, he studied her notebooks and letters, including the one from Randall.

SIR AARON KLUG: And in December, 1950, he writes her a letter, and I quote, "This means that as far as the experimental X-ray effort is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling." That letter was not seen by Wilkins. And that fact, and the fact that Wilkins was not present when Franklin arrived at King's College in January, 1951, led to a great deal of dissension later on.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: She thought that she was an independent researcher, and Maurice thought that she was his assistant, right? And that was a misunderstanding. And the responsibility of that misunderstanding lies in Randall's hands. Perhaps Maurice Wilkins could live with that kind of ambiguous situation more easily than Rosalind would. She didn't like that kind of unclear situation.

NARRATOR: The situation was inflamed by a basic personality clash. Franklin—articulate, passionate and always up for a good debate—and Wilkins—soft-spoken, deliberate and shy—just couldn't get along.

SIR AARON KLUG: She was a pretty tough person: single-minded, spoke what she believed and could, in fact, be quite fierce. And if she had been a man, it would have gone totally unremarked.

NARRATOR: Yet another barrier was social class and a private life entirely separate from the lab.

RAYMOND GOSLING: She had a very full social life. I mean, I know for a fact that at one stage, I think, she was going out with the first violin of the London Philharmonic. Now that is a cut above the beer-drinking chaps like us who were sitting in Finch's. And so to that extent...she had her own flat, she wasn't living in digs. She didn't suffer fools gladly, she was very intelligent, and she desperately wanted to get on with this work. She was so convinced that it was there like a ripe plum to be plucked from the tree.

NARRATOR: Despite all the tensions of the lab, Franklin applied herself to the task with single-minded determination, setting her sights on solving the structure of DNA. But now a new player was about to enter the game.

BRENDA MADDOX: While Rosalind was setting up her new lab at King's College London, James Watson—much younger, 23 but with a Ph.D.—had come to Europe because he wanted to study the gene, and he was convinced that the gene was the thing to study. This was going to be the secret of life.

NARRATOR: Watson goes to a conference in Naples where Wilkins shows one of his early, fuzzy diffraction images of DNA. Watson tries to meet Wilkins and wrangle an invitation to work at King's College.

JAMES WATSON (Race for the Double Helix, BBC, 1974): I tried to talk to him, but Maurice...afterwards, you know? His English...he doesn't talk much to strangers. And so I left and sort of the vague feeling that it would be nice if I could work with Maurice. But it wasn't the sort of obvious coming together of like minds.

NARRATOR: Wilkins does not take the bait. But shortly after, Watson is invited to the Cavendish, a famous research lab at Cambridge University, headed by Nobel Laureate, Sir Lawrence Bragg. There, Watson is assigned an office with another physicist turned crystallographer, Francis Crick, an old friend of Wilkins'. Crick and Watson immediately click.

But an hour away at King's College, the negative atmosphere takes a new turn for the worse. Rosalind Franklin is given the sarcastic nickname that Watson will later popularize in The Double Helix: Rosy.

MAURICE WILKINS: Oh yes, you know, it was with her walking around the lab sort of swinging her bag, making a bit like that on occasion. She provoked this sort of thing. Oh, poor Rosy, what a joke, silly joke.

RAYMOND GOSLING: A lot of people referred to her as Rosy behind her back, but nobody called her Rosy to her face.

NARRATOR: Despite the hostile environment, within months of her arrival at King's, Franklin is producing amazing results.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: Rosalind did the most professional work. She had a good camera because she developed a good camera. She got superb pictures, the best in those days.

SIR AARON KLUG: Within a few months, Franklin transformed the state of research at King's, but above all she discovered that there were two forms of DNA.

NARRATOR: Franklin's discovery that there are two forms of DNA is perhaps the most crucial step toward the ultimate discovery of its structure.

KIMBERLY MOWRY: Before Rosalind Franklin discovered that there were two distinct forms of DNA—the A and the B forms—people were probably looking at mixtures of those two forms. It would be sort of like if you had a picture of Mickey Mouse superimposed on a picture of Donald Duck. It would be almost impossible to understand what either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck looked like.

NARRATOR: The A is a drier, more crystalline form of DNA and produces more detailed images. The B is wetter and how DNA occurs in living cells. It produces a simpler image, but reveals a key clue to solving the structure of DNA. The X shape in the middle is the diffraction signature of a helix.

The significance is not lost on Franklin. She notes it in scientific shorthand and, according to Klug, presents her discovery.

SIR AARON KLUG: In November, 1951, Franklin gave a colloquium about her work and described the A and the B forms. She concentrated mostly on the A form. "And the A form," she says, "is likely to be helical like the B." The B, unquestionably in her view, was helical throughout. It was quite clear. But she was concentrating upon the A form because of the greater wealth of information you could get from it. That was her analytical approach.

NARRATOR: In the audience that day is James Watson, sent by Crick to gather intelligence on Franklin's labors. Crick and Watson are planning to use a different approach to solving the structure of DNA: model-building.

Within a week, Watson and Crick invite the scientists from King's College to see their model.

RAYMOND GOSLING: So Rosalind just was terribly amused. And she never took prisoners anyway, so she was pretty sharp in her criticism of the model and explained in detail why it couldn't be correct: one, two, three. And then we left.

NARRATOR: The model of DNA touted by Watson and Crick is an embarrassing failure.

BRENDA MADDOX: Well, as Watson himself said very frankly, he didn't know enough about crystallography to understand the meaning of her data. He missed that entirely, and he found himself really just preoccupied with her looks. "Why was she so plain? Why didn't she wear lipstick? She might have been pretty, if she had taken off her glasses and done something interesting with her hair."

NARRATOR: Lawrence Bragg, the head of the Cavendish Lab, is humiliated and forbids Watson and Crick to continue their model-making.

RAYMOND GOSLING: It was a happy moment for Rosalind and me, because it justified her interpretation that you could build models, but you couldn't prove which was the right one. And here they were, the model builders, hard at it, and they had produced completely the wrong model.

NARRATOR: To Franklin, the incident is an affirmation of her training: that experimentation and patient analysis of the data will reveal the answer. But what Franklin may not know, is that her unpublished findings will continue to make their way to Watson and Crick. And they are getting there through the deputy director of her own lab, Maurice Wilkins.

BRENDA MADDOX: Gradually, Wilkins felt shut out of his own subject. So he began going up to Cambridge to talk to his old friend—and he was an old friend—Francis Crick about DNA, which he was still interested in, and about this terrible Rosy who was hoarding, he felt, her data. So inadvertently, Wilkins was the conduit. A lot of information from Rosalind and from King's actually passed its way to Cambridge, so that even if Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA, they were speculating.

NARRATOR: But while Crick and Watson speculate, Franklin continues to analyze and collect new information. In May, 1952, she sets up the X-ray diffractometer to take an image of the wetter form of DNA, the B.

Today, X-ray diffraction technology, vastly improved, is still used to explore molecular structure.

JOANNE YEH (Brown University): At the end of this glass capillary is a DNA fiber, similar to the kind that Rosalind Franklin worked with. And it is so small that it's difficult to see it with your naked eye. Rosalind Franklin had to bundle together 20 of these fibers, in order to get X-ray diffraction images.

NARRATOR: Now, scientists use DNA crystals, which give better results than these microscopic fibers. Twenty of them bundled together are about the thickness of a human hair.

And with X-ray beams at least 300 times stronger today than in Franklin's time, it can take only seconds to expose an image that took Franklin 100 hours. Now, a computer interprets the image and swiftly calculates a 3-D model. But in Franklin's time, analyzing diffraction patterns could require thousands of calculations done by hand, and interpreting a single image could take more than a year.

JOANNE YEH:	So, for Rosalind Franklin to go through the calculation, she had to have perseverance and motivation and a real drive and to do all of the calculation that was necessary by hand.

NARRATOR: In May, 1952, Franklin's perseverance and exacting techniques pay off, producing the sharpest image yet of the B form of DNA. She labels it "Photo 51" and puts it aside while she continues her work on the A form. But around this time, Franklin will acquire another nickname: The Dark Lady. She is so unhappy at King's, she arranges to leave. She agrees to finish analyzing her data, write up her findings and stay until the end of the year.

RAYMOND GOSLING: I was very sorry that she should find it necessary to leave, but of course appreciated that there was no alternative, that the Crown Prince and the Dark Lady were never going to get on together. He wasn't going to leave, so it was obvious that Rosalind was going to leave.

NARRATOR: In the midst of this transition, someone gives Photo 51 to Wilkins.

RAYMOND GOSLING: I cannot remember how he came by this beautiful picture. It may have been given to him by Rosalind, or it may have been me.

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, at the Cavendish, a new researcher moves into the lab with Watson and Crick: Peter Pauling, the son of the renowned guru of chemistry from Caltech, Linus Pauling.

Only a year ago, Pauling had pioneered the same model-building technique adopted by Watson and Crick. With little experimental data, Pauling had come up with the structure for long stretches of proteins, a single-stranded helix. Now Pauling sends his son a paper in which he proposes a structure for DNA.

JAMES WATSON:	Of course we were upset. The question was, could he be right? And we knew that Linus didn't have a good X-ray photograph. So could he have thought it through without any of the King's data?

NARRATOR: The answer was no. Pauling makes some of the same mistakes that Watson and Crick had made on their first model, a three-stranded helix with the bases on the outside. But Pauling's mistake will be discovered as soon as he publishes.

Watson knows that if Pauling gets access to Rosalind Franklin's data, he could quickly come up with the correct model. Now, the race begins in earnest. Watson estimates he and Crick have six weeks to solve the problem.

Around the time Franklin gives her last presentation at King's College, Jim Watson shows up in her office. He tries to show her Pauling's paper, perhaps to convince her that Pauling will beat them to solve the structure of DNA, if she doesn't pool her data with him and Crick. And according to Watson's account, he implies that she is incompetent in interpreting X-ray pictures.

BRENDA MADDOX: And as he tells us in The Double Helix, "She began to advance toward me, and," he said, "fearing that in her anger she might strike me, I retreated." Which is actually absurd; she was almost half his size.

NARRATOR: Watson then reports that he runs into Maurice Wilkins. Wilkins shows Watson Photo 51.

MAURICE WILKINS: And when he saw this, suddenly...well I was surprised. I said "Oh!" like this, you see? I thought, "Oh, well, this must have been done in the last couple of days or something." But it occurred to me it had been lying there for several months.

NARRATOR: "My mouth fell open and my pulse began to race," Watson says in The Double Helix. It is the clear X pattern, the signature of a helix, that ignites his excitement. But there's more.

SIR AARON KLUG: From this photo alone you can deduce the number of units per turn, per helical turn, that were in the helix.

NARRATOR: The number of lines in the photo shows that each twist of the helix has 10 units, or molecular building blocks. And the dimensions of the image correspond to a helix of 34 angstroms per turn. Wilkins gives this crucial information to Watson.

SIR AARON KLUG: So they get the basic parameters for building the helical backbones.

NARRATOR: On the train back to Cambridge, Watson sketches Photo 51 on his newspaper and reports to Crick. Based on Franklin's data, Crick and Watson go to Lawrence Bragg, the head of the Cavendish lab, and he gives them permission, once again, to build a model. They begin on February 4, 1953.

BRENDA MADDOX: Then they have another idea. They knew that data from all of King's biophysics unit, including Rosalind's work, was published in a report for the Medical Research Council.

NARRATOR: In the MRC report, Franklin places DNA in a class of molecules with a certain type of symmetry, as these simple drawings in her notebook illustrate. The implications of that symmetry would be obvious to an expert like Francis Crick.

SIR AARON KLUG: The MRC report contains Franklin's data: the symmetry of the A form, all the crystal parameters, but above all, the symmetry. It was this symmetry which tells Crick there were two chains running in opposite directions.

NARRATOR: Two strands, each with the sugars and phosphates running in different directions: an anti-parallel double helix. But where do the bases go? On the outside, as Watson and Crick depicted in their first model, or the inside, as Franklin had told them?

There were two important clues. A few years earlier, a British scientist, William Astbury, theorized that the four bases—adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine—would be stacked like pennies. And at Columbia University, Erwin Chargaff discovered that DNA always contains equal amounts of adenine and thymine, as well as equal amounts of guanine and cytosine.

At first, Watson thought that the bases must be paired like with like: A with A, G with G, and so on. But an office mate, Jerry Donohue, shows him that he's using the wrong chemical forms.

With the right forms, Watson then makes a giant leap. He finds he can fit the bases into the helix measured by Franklin if he pairs A with T and G with C. Arranged this way, the bases form the connecting rungs in a twisting ladder on the inside of a double helix.

It is Rosalind Franklin's experimental framework, a collection of evidence painstakingly accumulated over two years, that guides Watson and Crick to solve the structure of DNA.

And in another eureka moment, the structure rewards them with the immediate realization of how DNA replicates. Unzipping the helix produces two templates to create two new helices, each identical to the original. DNA isn't just a molecule, it's the blueprint for life.

In one the most famous understatements in science, Watson and Crick write, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."

The day was Saturday, February 28, 1953.

BRENDA MADDOX: That was the day that they went into the pub, The Eagle, and Crick told everybody, "We've discovered the secret of life."

NARRATOR: Now that they have discovered the secret of life, they have another problem to solve. How are they going to prove it? Once again, they need Franklin. She travels to Cambridge to review the model.

SIR AARON KLUG: And Watson writes in his book that, "her immediate acceptance of the model amazed me." But she, she understood immediately that the model was correct. What perhaps she didn't know was how much of her data they had known in order to build that model.

BRENDA MADDOX: Rosalind's part in the great discovery was obscured by a series of maneuvers made behind her back. The thing is that Watson and Crick wanted to publish quickly to get ahead of Linus Pauling in California. But they were held back by the embarrassing fact that all the experimental work that had led to their great leaps of the imagination had been done at a rival institution, at King's. And Rosalind's data hadn't been published.

NARRATOR: According to Brenda Maddox, Bragg, of the Cavendish, and Randall, of King's, approach the editors of Nature to engineer a solution. They agree to publish three articles within a single issue: Watson and Crick's article first, Wilkins and his collaborator next, and last is Franklin and Gosling's article. Its position at the end suggests Franklin's findings merely confirm Watson and Crick's model instead of providing the essential data used to formulate it.

SIR JOHN MADDOX (Former Editor, Nature): The Crick and Watson paper doesn't say in what particular respects they were indebted to Franklin for her work.

NARRATOR: Sir John Maddox, later editor of Nature for two decades, shows how Franklin's contribution was obscured by Watson and Crick with a single guarded sentence.

SIR JOHN MADDOX: They say, "We have been stimulated by a general knowledge of her work." But in fact, they had particular knowledge of her work. And I, as an editor, would have smelled a rat at that.

NARRATOR: Franklin had written her own article a month before she saw the model. Inserted by hand into the original text is the sentence, "Thus our general ideas are consistent with the model proposed by Crick and Watson." Indeed, her ideas were consistent with their model, because they largely based their model on her ideas.

LYNN OSMAN ELKIN: What did Watson and Crick have without Rosalind Franklin's data? And the answer is, "almost nothing." They were poised to figure it out, their work was brilliant, but they couldn't do it without Rosalind Franklin's data.

NARRATOR: In fact, Rosalind Franklin could be said to be Watson and Crick's unknowing, and unrecognized, collaborator. By the time the articles appeared in Nature, on April 25, 1953, Franklin had taken her new position at Birkbeck College in London.

In her 5th floor office under a leaky skylight, she often left an umbrella open on her desk to protect her papers. She headed the virus research lab from 1953 to 1958 and thrived in Birkbeck's collegial atmosphere, much like her beloved Laboratoire in Paris.

Here, she made what she called her greatest discovery, working out the complex structure of a virus and locating its infectious element. She collaborated with Aaron Klug who later wins a Nobel Prize.

SIR AARON KLUG: She worked out the exact geometry so that...it was important in history that you could actually do such things. The thing about Rosalind was that she was single-minded and she could tackle these large and difficult problems.

NARRATOR: Franklin's virus work secured her international reputation and brought many invitations to speak in the United States. In 1956, she celebrated her 36th birthday while visiting universities in California, and climbed Mt. Whitney, one of the highest peaks in North America. But near the end of her trip, Franklin was suffering from severe abdominal pains. On her return to England she was diagnosed with cancer. There is speculation that her work with X-rays may have triggered the disease.

SUE RICHLEY:	She handled it marvelously.

ANNE PIPER:	Yup, she was in the Marsden, the cancer hospital, and there she was in a private, well a single room at the end of the corridor with work papers and calculations all around.

DONALD CASPER (Florida State University): She was still optimistic and confident that things were going to get better.

NARRATOR: Don Caspar, an American colleague, recalls her struggle to climb from the basement lab to her fifth floor office upstairs.

DONALD CASPER:	Up until the end, she was still working away. We had wished we could help her, but unfortunately there was nothing could be done.

BRENDA MADDOX: After a year and a half of terrible illness, painful treatment, she asked her doctor for a frank prognosis, and he told her to seek the consolations of religion. She was furious. She was not religious. She had a full agenda. She had an invitation to a fellowship in Caracas. She was too busy to die.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: Rosalind and I were going to attend a meeting in Leeds, and she suggested that we could drive and go and visit some of the Norman cathedrals. When I arrived in London, I called her, because I expected to stay with her. And there was no answer. And after several attempts to get her on the phone, I called Aaron Klug, who I knew rather well, and he told me she was in hospital. So until the very last day, she hoped that she could go to the countryside with a friend. And she died while we were at Leeds, at the meeting.

NARRATOR: Her epitaph reads "Scientist: her research and discoveries on viruses remain of lasting benefit to mankind." She died April 16, 1958. That same day, the London Times carried an article acclaiming her virus model, which was unveiled at the Brussels World Fair.

Her obituary in the New York Times called her "one of a select band of pioneers unraveling virus diseases and genetics."

She went to the grave never knowing how much Watson and Crick had relied on her work to make their great discovery. Or if she knew, she didn't care.

In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins won the Nobel Prize for their discovery of the structure of DNA. Franklin's name receives no mention, save a passing reference by Wilkins. Her crucial contribution to their work becomes a footnote in scientific history.

VITTORIO LUZZATI: Rosalind probably would have been forgotten—not by her friends, we would not have forgotten Rosalind, but, I mean, by the public in general. If we talk about Rosalind, it is because of the way Jim Watson offended her memory.

NARRATOR: In 1968, James Watson published The Double Helix, his personal account of the discovery of the structure of DNA. In his book, Watson casts Franklin as uncooperative, unattractive and "incompetent in interpreting X-ray pictures." And yet, Watson admits he needs her findings. He even boasts of using her work without her knowledge or permission, saying, "Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data. For that matter, no one at King's realized they were in our hands."

When the book was in rough draft, Harvard University Press asked those mentioned in the manuscript to read it. Many, including Crick and Wilkins, objected so strongly that, in a highly unprecedented move, Harvard withdrew its offer to publish. The book came out with a popular press and became an instant best seller.

BRENDA MADDOX: But most of the main portraits were modified, all except Rosalind, who was dead. And every writer knows you can't libel the dead.

NARRATOR: Franklin's family and colleagues protested Watson's portrayal of, as one put it, "that gifted girl who could not defend herself."

BRENDA MADDOX: So Watson obliged. And he wrote a pious epilogue saying as a young man he had not appreciated the difficulties that women had in being accepted and making their way in science And the epilogue is there, but it does nothing to alter or soften the character of this, of this terrible Rosy.

NARRATOR: Watson declined NOVA's request for an interview.

Franklin is now receiving some long overdue recognition: plaques where she lived and worked, and, recently, Britain's Royal Society created the Rosalind Franklin Award to support women in science.

When Sir Aaron Klug won his Nobel Prize, in part for the work he started with Franklin, he, unlike the DNA trio, honored her contribution.

SIR AARON KLUG: As I said in my Nobel lecture, she made quite an impression on me, where she pointed the way to tackling important, difficult problems, no matter how long they took.

BRENDA MADDOX: Rosalind died at 37 with no sense of having been edged out in a race that only Watson and Crick knew was a race. She died proud of her world reputation in coal and virus research. She was cheated of the only thing she really wanted, which was a chance to finish her work. My view? Her lost prize was life.

NARRATOR: Just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, there is a hospital unlike any other.

FELICIA NUTTER (Staff Veterinarian): This is definitely cutting edge.

NARRATOR: While its patients are bright, appealing and furry, they are also a critical barometer of the decline of our oceans.

This adult male sea lion's neck is entangled in some human garbage. He cannot eat and is quickly losing weight, so a team from the Marine Mammal Center needs to capture him and get him back to the hospital.

SHELBI STOUDT (Volunteer): If he's in your net, we want to try to get him into the bigger net. Our goal is to sneak up on him and surprise him, because no matter how sick or injured the animal is, all it has to do is roll over into the water and we can't get him.

Pull back.

NARRATOR: It's not all that easy. For this sea lion, the story has a happy ending. A month later he is sighted sunning himself on a San Francisco pier, and the entanglement had fallen off. But for hundreds of animals along the California coast, this hospital makes the difference between life and death.

Theirs is an all-out effort to save these animals from our increasingly troubled oceans. High-end veterinary science and a passion for marine mammals, right now on NOVA: Ocean Animal Emergency.

Major funding for NOVA is provided by the following:

Well, it might surprise a lot of people that ExxonMobil would be interested in lithium ion battery technology applied to hybrid electric vehicles. Our new battery separator film is a true breakthrough that's going to enable the deployment of more hybrid vehicles, faster. This means a tremendous reduction in greenhouse gases, the equivalent of removing millions of cars from the road. I think this is the most important project that I've worked on in my career.

And David H. Koch. And...

Discover new knowledge: HHMI.

And by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you.

NARRATOR: Pier 39: San Francisco's famous tourist attraction and home to hundreds of playful California sea lions.

BOY (Tourist): Look! Coming in!

NARRATOR: But while they captivate the tourists here, not far away, others are in danger. And each spring, like clockwork, many start hitting the beaches in distress. The response that is launched is one of the most compelling wild animal rescue operations in America.

SHELBI STOUDT: Marine Mammal Center, this is Shelbi.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER DISPATCHER 1: About how big is the animal?

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER DISPATCHER 2: Did you see any injuries on the animal?

SHELBI STOUDT: And what beach are you on?

NARRATOR: This is the Marine Mammal Center, based in Sausalito, California. It dispatches rescue teams along the Northern California coast to save sick and dying animals.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER DISPATCHER 3: We'll go ahead and send a crew over to check him out.

We're going to check out an elephant seal. We got the call about five minutes ago.

NARRATOR: And while the beaches are beautiful, the condition of the animals on them can be heartbreaking.

VOLUNTEER: It's over there.

NARRATOR: This call is from Pebble Beach, near Monterey, for an elephant seal that is weak and near death.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER DISPATCHER 3: There are a lot of flies on his face. He's underweight. You can see his backbone. We should pick him up.

JURGE (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): Board first, behind the animal, then we will get in with the carrier.

NARRATOR: Wood boards are used to corral the pups and protect the rescuers.

JURGE: Watch his flippers, his head.

NARRATOR: Even a weak wild animal can still put up quite a fight.

JURGE: Nice and easy rescue.

NARRATOR: Every day brings new animals, during the busy spring season. Some are easily reached on the beaches, but the rescue teams must head out to where the injured animals are. Some are caught in marinas.

SHELBI STOUDT: Stop.

NARRATOR: Others are on the dangerous rock jetties of Monterey Bay.

SHAWN (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): See that real big guy who's barking and moving over there?

NARRATOR: These rescues require specially trained dive teams. The sick animals are then transported to an ocean-side hospital in Sausalito. This hospital has an E.R., an I.C.U., and even treats infants. And instead of beds, each patient has a pool. The cafeteria specializes in raw fish.

During the busy season, three different species of marine animals show up at the emergency room: There are northern elephant seals, like our pup from Pebble Beach. They can grow to 13 feet and weigh two tons. The males have a characteristic elephant-like snout. California sea lions—like the ones on the jetties in Monterey or Pier 39—they are far more mobile and playful than elephant seals and can use their flippers to walk on. Some research shows them to be closely related to bears and dogs. California sea lions are gregarious and easily trained. And then there are the incredibly cute, but incredibly vulnerable harbor seal pups. These seals are the most skittish of all and like to keep their distance from humans. The pups come in weighing just a few pounds but should grow to five or six feet. Elephant seals, sea lions and harbor seals, all are treated here.

Our elephant seal pup from Pebble beach gets checked in. She is weighed and painted with an identifying head marker. The tradition at the Marine Mammal Center is that the person who finds the animal names it. Her given name is Ouzel, a type of water bird.

FRANCES GULLAND (Veterinarian Director): Ouzel is going to go from just having a little red head to actually having a number.

NARRATOR: Once checked in, every animal gets a full veterinary workup.

FRANCES GULLAND: First thing we'll do is the length.

NARRATOR: Frances Gulland is the chief veterinarian.

FRANCES GULLAND: So, nose to tail, 128. She is very underweight, and then she has a patch of oil on her head, a little dehydrated, but so far she looks like a malnourished pup.

NARRATOR: Gulland and her team are on the front lines of marine animal medicine and believe they are witnessing devastating changes in the ecology of our oceans.

FRANCES GULLAND: At lot of change is happening. If you stop to think about how much change there has been in recent years, it's pretty dramatic.

NARRATOR: When these animals show up at the E.R., many are at serious risk. Only about 50 percent will survive. The next few weeks will be crucial for Ouzel.

And like any emergency room, you never know what will happen next.

This young Harbor Seal pup came into the Center underweight and frail with a strange cluster of growths on its mouth. Frances and her colleague, Dr. Felicia Nutter, want to see if they can remove the tumors and give this animal a fighting chance back in the wild.

FELICIA NUTTER: Your first response when you see him is, "Oh my, what's that?" Because he looks pretty bad. But then as you work with him and watch him you realize he's a normal harbor seal pup in all other ways.

What do you think? I think, for me, it's a little bit beyond me, but for a soft tissue surgeon it might be like, "ah, pheph."

We don't know if this is a problem that was just a hiccup in embryological development. It might be something that was influenced by contaminants in the marine environment. It might be something that was influenced by the oil spill in November. We really don't know what caused it.

NARRATOR: X-rays are ordered and this pup, barely a week old, is given anesthesia.

Much of the veterinary medicine practiced here was developed here. The Marine Mammal Center is the foremost research hospital for these animals anywhere in the world. Francis Gulland has pioneered many of these treatments.

Gulland and team recently discovered a link between high cancer rates in California sea lions and concentrations of toxic chemicals, like P.C.B.s, in their blubber.

Are these tumors a related case?

FELICIA NUTTER: Let's check that x-ray and see if there's anything.

NARRATOR: A day in the life of this ocean E.R. is much like that at any busy city hospital: Part high-end science...

FRANCES GULLAND: ...want to try, maybe, doing a lateral head.

NARRATOR: ...part three-ring circus.

SHELBI STOUDT: Marine Mammal Center, this is Shelbi.

NARRATOR: While the doctors treat the sick, Shelbi Stoudt mans the phones.

SHELBI STOUDT: Are you familiar with the differences between seals and sea lions?

That's okay. What color is the fur on the animal?

NARRATOR: A seal is spotted on the beach just below the Center. Instead of waiting for the crew on duty, Shelbi jumps into action. At four-feet-seven, she's smaller than many of the animals she needs to rescue, but she says her size is an advantage.

SHELBI STOUDT: The benefit that I have is, in the marine mammal world, size is what matters. So these animals don't expect something of my stature to be able to outwit them.

I don't move slow if you haven't figured that out about me.

FILM CREW MEMBER: No, we did.

NARRATOR: As suspected, it's another malnourished elephant seal pup. The green mark on her head indicates that she may have been in trouble before, and there is a sore on her neck they will have to investigate.

FELICIA NUTTER: Northern elephant seals, they're born and then nursed for about a month. And then the moms wean them—it's called a hard weaning—and the moms go back to sea.

NARRATOR: After the mom leaves, pups like this must survive off their own blubber, until they figure out how to eat on their own. The ones that need to be rescued just haven't made it.

SHELBI STOUDT: It takes a lot of energy for them to maneuver.

NARRATOR: Given that this is Mother Nature's way for the elephant seals, is it appropriate to intervene?

FELICIA NUTTER: We provide a humane response to animals that are in distress. So before the Marine Mammal Center was established, in 1975, there was no recourse for animals on our beaches. They were left to live or die as they might.

SHELBI STOUDT: Okay, now, we're going to tilt.

FELICIA NUTTER: And the other part of the equation is the impact that humans have had on the natural environment. The wetlands that were there a hundred years ago are really greatly diminished, and so the animals are being forced into smaller and smaller areas and into closer contact with people.

NARRATOR: Rescuing and caring for these animals costs millions of dollars a year, all paid by charitable contributions.

Since Shelbi rescued this one, she gets to name it.

SHELBI STOUDT: Question: could we name it "Your Sister?"

DEB WICKHAM (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): If Your Mom is okay with that.

SHELBI STOUDT: Okay, Your Sister it is.

NARRATOR: Naming animals here is kind of a game. Each year themes develop. One year it was cocktails—Martini, Mimosa and Mojito have come and gone. This year it's all about family.

SHELBI STOUDT: Your Sister goes along with another seal name that we have on site called Your Mom. It's a lot of fun for us to say, "Your Mom is getting fat," "Your Mom is throwing up." So we did Your Sister.

FELICIA NUTTER: Is that Your Sister?

SHELBI STOUDT: Yes.

FELICIA NUTTER: She doesn't look a thing like you.

NARRATOR: Once an animal has been stabilized and seen by the vets, they are fed. And what do you feed a baby seal? A fish milkshake, of course, made from a combination of ground up herring and animal baby formula.

And like with any baby, a lot revolves around feedings. Plus, seals need to be fat to survive in the ocean.

Our Pebble Beach pup, Ouzel, is getting her much needed meal through what appears to be a rather intense feeding process called tubing.

MARIE DESTEFANIS (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): The tube is inserted down into the stomach. There is no pain associated with it at all. I think mostly it's just stressful, so we try and do it as quickly as possible. And then, when we know we are in, we just gently put the fish milkshake into the stomach.

STACY BERYACK (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): The alternative is to have them die of malnutrition, yeah, which is a horrible thing to watch.

NARRATOR: The bulk of the work at the Marine Mammal Center is provided by a remarkable group of volunteers, all trained in basic marine animal care.

Most days Stacy Bezyack is a business consultant, but for the last seven years, she has given one day a week to wrangling these animals.

STACY BERYACK: It's a big part of my life. A lot of people give up one of their two free days off to come here and deal with these guys and put up with crap from them, too.

NARRATOR: The goal with all these animals is to get them into good enough shape to go back into the sea, but to be released they must be a healthy weight and eating fish on their own. Surprisingly, most of these animals have no instinct to eat fish and must learn, just like a baby human.

RAYA SMITH (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): When the animal turns from you, that's "no interest."

NARRATOR: Raya Smith was particularly well trained for this job. She worked for years as an elementary school special ed teacher.

RAYA SMITH: It is special ed because you need to be patient with them. You need to allow them to grow as they grow. Some move faster than others. They are very much an individual. So I believe in the slow, steady kindness approach.

NARRATOR: Our pup, Ouzel, hasn't quite gotten it, which puts him at serious risk.

JOYCE FOX (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): He's not even moving his whiskers forward, which indicates he's not interested.

NARRATOR: This California sea lion was entangled in some floating ocean garbage, which cut deeply into his head. Entanglements like these are common for ocean animals, in part because they're so smart and curious. But entanglements are a particularly gruesome example of how pollution can be deadly in the ocean.

This sea lion is lucky; the rescue team cut off the entanglement. The vets now think he's ready to be released. He was captured on April 15, tax day, and because he put up such a nasty fight, he was named Taxman.

Today Taxman is going home, if the volunteers can get him.

Since sea lions, unlike seals, can use their flippers to walk, they are much faster and harder to wrangle. Eventually, Taxman plays right into their hands.

LEE JACKREL (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): Sometimes they're surprisingly cooperative. It's rare, but always makes us look good when it happens.

NARRATOR: Healthy animals are released as soon as possible, so they don't become too used to humans.

Taxman is shipped out to an isolated beach in Point Reyes National Seashore, where the chances are good he'll meet up with another group of sea lions.

KAT (Marine Mammal Center Volunteer): Going to put them back on? For him? He's coming right out.

NARRATOR: Only about half of the hospital's patients make it to a successful release. Each one that does is a small victory for the Center's volunteers.

The entanglement scar is a clear indicator that Taxman got too close to human activity in the past, so maybe here, at such a remote place, he'll do better.

NARRATOR: Back at the hospital, the animals keep coming in. Some are dropped off at the door, literally.

This baby harbor seal was found abandoned in Bodega Bay by Phil and Jean Warren, who live near a seal breeding spot.

Jean is a painter and has decided that this year she will name every pup she finds after a French artist.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER VOLUNTEER 1: What did you name him?

JEAN WARREN: His name is Marcel Duchamp, a real feisty artist.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER VOLUNTEER 1: Oh, we're back in the artists.

JEAN WARREN: Yes. Today was Duchamp. We've had Magritte, Degas. Who else?

PHIL WARREN: Brought two in last week and both of them were artists.

JEAN WARREN: Matisse and Cezanne were last week.

NARRATOR: This is Duchamp.

These little newborns were separated from their mothers before they had finished nursing, and, as such, received few of the antibodies in her milk. So they are highly susceptible to infections.

The harbor seals are kept in a special part of the Marine Mammal Center, a kind of pediatric intensive care unit. These little newborns are the most delicate animals onsite. Duchamp will be kept in the I.C.U., until he has stabilized and is less vulnerable.

Back in the operating room, the x-rays of the young harbor seal with the tumor cluster are not encouraging.

FELICIA NUTTER: This is the area of concern.

NARRATOR: It looks like the tumor goes deep inside his jaw.

FRANCES GULLAND: It feels like there's something actually within the mandible on the left side. Yes, I'm convinced that his left mandible is involved.

NARRATOR: A deformity like this cannot be fixed for a wild animal and would make him too vulnerable to predators.

FRANCES GULLAND: So it looks like it's basically not operable, and it's a congenital defect. So at this point, we feel the best thing for him is to euthanize him rather than to wake him up.

FELICIA NUTTER: In cases where we think the impairments are really significant and are going to impair their abilities to function normally and to have a good fighting chance at living as normal a life as possible, then we do what we consider the humane thing and euthanize those animals.

FRANCES GULLAND: You can't half fix it. Or you can't keep it on drugs, you know, every three hours give it a little something. It either has to be better and able to fend for itself or, or not. There's no gray area where you can just keep it as your pet.

FELICIA NUTTER: Euthanasia means "a good death." It's not something I ever take lightly. I don't know anybody that does take that lightly. It is a life or death decision.

FRANCES GULLAND: It's a very peaceful way to go.

NARRATOR: Every animal that dies here is given a complete post mortem exam. Tissue samples are taken as part of an ongoing analysis of the health of these animal populations and the declining conditions of our oceans.

FRANCES GULLAND: On more of an ecological perspective, they are the top of the food chain in the ocean. They are a really good indicator of some of the ecosystem changes that we're seeing today.

NARRATOR: But finding out what factors have changed in our oceans cannot happen only in a hospital with sick animals. Understanding their normal healthy behavior is essential.

And there is no better way to do that than with Dan Costa at the Año Nuevo State Reserve, above Santa Cruz, California.

These are northern elephant seals. They are the full-grown version of our pups, Ouzel and Your Sister. Females weigh up to a ton, the males can be more than two.

Each spring, Costa, a biologist from the University of California, Santa Cruz, outfits of few of these massive seals with satellite tags.

DANIEL COSTA (University of California, Santa Cruz, Long Marine Laboratory): We're exploring how these animals make a living, where they find their food, how they get it and how hard they have to work to get it.

There isn't a book that we can go and flip through to see what a sea lion or a seal does. Some of the simplest things about these animals we've only recently begun to understand.

So do you got an animal for us?

MELINDA FOWLER (Graduate Student): Yes, we have an adult female, about three animals in, up there on the ledge.

NARRATOR: Graduate student, Melinda Fowler has located a six-year-old female with a flipper tag showing that she was born here. It's an indication that she is likely to return, so the team can retrieve their satellite receiver, if they can get it on in the first place.

MELINDA FOWLER: It can be a little bit dangerous, we really have to play each situation by ear and go up there kind of quietly and see how they react and see how we can best give...try and give her the sedative.

NARRATOR: The seal is given a sedative and, in about 15 minutes, is much less concerned about what's going on.

DANIEL COSTA: So these are the tags we are going to be putting out today. Because we want to get the transmission and it only transmits when the animal is out of the water, you put it on the animal's head, so...electronic yarmulke. This is hardware-store-variety five minute epoxy. We're just gluing this tag onto the hair of the animal.

NARRATOR: The team takes advantage of the elephant seal's easygoing, drug- induced condition to get a few vital measurements...

MELINDA FOWLER: Length seal, 105.

NARRATOR: ...including her length, girth and weight. So how do you weigh a full grown elephant seal? You deploy a lot of grad students.

GRADUATE STUDENT 1: Ah, we're off.

GRADUATE STUDENT 2: Read it.

GRADUATE STUDENT 1: 346 kilos.

NARRATOR: If you look at them lying on the beach, the life of these animals seems pretty lazy, but the data recorders tell a whole different story.

DANIEL COSTA: When we got the first records back we were absolutely astounded. The elephant seals go all over the north Pacific. We have some individuals that went beyond the international dateline. That's twice the distance to Hawaii or probably two times the width the United States.

NARRATOR: This is one of the longest animal migrations anywhere in the world, made in order to find enough food. Each seal does it alone every year and usually returns to the exact same beach.

DANIEL COSTA: When you are limited to just studying them on the beach, you do get this idea that life must be easy for an elephant seal, that this is all it is. They just kind of sit around and do nothing. When you get these records back, showing the animals spending 80, 90 percent of their time at sea, non-stop working...you never see them resting on the surface. They're just nonstop diving. You kind of think, "Well, they have earned that rest on the beach."

FELICIA NUTTER: When I first saw some of the satellite tracking maps for these animals, I was saying to my friends and my husband, it's like the Serengeti of the sea. It is, but nobody sees it.

NARRATOR: It's hard to believe that a little pup like Your Sister or Ouzel, who are just learning to eat fish, should someday be able to swim halfway across the Pacific and back.

But thanks to the tubing and fish milkshakes they are, at least, getting fat. So is little Duchamp, the harbor seal.

Weight gain is a proxy for health here at the Marine Mammal Center. Not only do seals need to be fat to survive in the ocean, appetite can be a major diagnostic clue in the world of veterinary medicine.

FELICIA NUTTER: Veterinarians treat the spectrum, from the tiniest little fish to elephants. But they can't talk to us, they can't tell us verbally what symptoms they are experiencing. So we have to use our skills of observation to really look for changes in the behavior of the animals, which can be very subtle.

NARRATOR: All of the animals are observed daily, by the volunteers. Records are kept of their behavior, what they eat and how much weight they gain. There are daily rounds, just like in a human hospital, where abnormal cases are discussed.

FELICIA NUTTER: He had a rough couple of days, so...but he does look better.

NARRATOR: Deb Wickham oversees the animals' daily care and is often the first to notice a problem.

FELICIA NUTTER: Xilia. Go, Deb.

DEB WICKHAM: I have concern about Xilia. Well, she is not eating. I don't know. She just doesn't seem normal to me. I don't know what's going on.

NARRATOR: Xilia is a harbor seal pup, on the surface, like any other.

FELICIA NUTTER: We'll see what we can do. Hopefully, we can get her to eat.

NARRATOR: But something is not quite right.

FELICIA NUTTER: Everybody that works with her just sort of has an impression that she is not normal. Her behavior is not normal.

Just kind of go slowly. She's not even looking. She is at least chewing it to pieces.

It's fairly subtle. She's just too tolerant. She should be more aggressive. And she has been here for months, and we're still not able to get her to eat fish normally. And so we've ruled out some things that we thought might have been responsible for her inability to swallow fish normally, and so we are sort left a little bit puzzled, scratching our heads a little bit as to the suite of abnormalities that we are seeing. What does it all mean?

NARRATOR: So far, this season, Xilia has been getting a lot of medical attention. She was x-rayed a few weeks ago, here at the Center, to see if there was something obstructing her esophagus. But nothing was found.

Today, she is going where no harbor seal has gone before. With cooperation of a private cardiac clinic, Xilia is going to get a state of the art CAT scan.

FELICIA NUTTER: The medical office where we are going to be doing this procedure, they are very enthusiastic and interested.

NARRATOR: This is a first for the Marine Mammal Center.

FELICIA NUTTER: So we're actually doing this procedure as a collaboration and not getting charged for it. It's scientific discovery work at its best.

JAMES ADAMS (Cardiovascular Associates): It will be interesting to see. I'm not sure what a seal's heart looks like. I'm told it looks fairly similar to a human's, so we will see.

NARRATOR: A few years ago, there was a similar case to Xilia's.

FELICIA NUTTER: There was a case, several years before I started working at the Center, of a harbor seal with a similar history. And at necropsy they found that she had half a brain, she had hemi-cerebral agenesis.

When the animal was euthanized and examined, it only had half a brain. And that was a congenital defect. Behaviorally, the animal seemed pretty normal, except it never learned how to swallow fish and eat fish. And so that sort of come to mind. People are going, "Oh, remember that seal, kind of like this, that only had half a brain?"

So, the C.T. scan, we are hoping, will serve several purposes. We'll be able to get an examination of her brain and see if we see any abnormalities in her brain. It will also let us look at her esophagus. We'll be able see if there is something we've missed.

TECH 1: I think we're ready to go?

TECH 2: Ready?

FELICIA NUTTER: Yeah. That's amazing. Look at that. Look at that.

NARRATOR: As the images come through, the power of this technology becomes clear. It's like a full dissection without ever touching the patient.

FELICIA NUTTER: Do you guys ever get tired of this?

This is definitely cutting edge. It's cutting edge human medicine, and so it's definitely cutting edge wildlife veterinary medicine.

DOCTOR 1: Slice into the brain.

FELICIA NUTTER: There's her brain, filling out the cranium. So, as far as we can tell she's got a full brain.

DOCTOR 1: Yes, she has a full brain.

FELICIA NUTTER: And everything looks bilaterally symmetrical, no obvious infarcts, no...

DOCTOR 1: No obvious infarcts, no evidence of bleeding in the brain.

FELICIA NUTTER: It looks like...that everything that is there is supposed to be, and nothing is there that shouldn't be there.

DOCTOR 1: Here's her lung tissue, right here.

NARRATOR: The early analysis of the CAT scan is encouraging. There are no glaring abnormalities. But from a treatment point of view, that's frustrating, too.

FELICIA NUTTER: At this point, I don't have any more answers. I'm never satisfied by that. I always want to figure out exactly what happened. But sometimes we don't.

NARRATOR: Sometimes animals at the Center die, and the cause is never known. In Xilia's case, they'll keep observing her, hoping for clues that might save her.

Meanwhile, another animal has come in, exhibiting more acute symptoms. She's a California sea lion named Sardine.

FELICIA NUTTER: Let's see if she sees you come in. Make some noise up there by her head. Okay, so, little response, touching her. She's definitely abnormal. A normal adult sea lion should be very aggressive. She's not just slow. Slow would be that she knows you are there but is slow. She's arousable, but that's about it.

NARRATOR: This time, the doctors believe they know what is causing the symptoms. It's a problem they've been seeing every year, since 1998.

FRANCES GULLAND: In 1998, we had about 70 animals in here, there were up to 400 other animals affected on the coastline. These animals were stranding, day after day, and each one had the same signs.

NARRATOR: What Gulland saw were sea lions, mostly adults, in serious trouble. Many had already died along the beaches.

FRANCES GULLAND: Seizures is the main symptom. The animals have convulsions.

NARRATOR: A team was quickly assembled to investigate.

FRANCES GULLAND: And putting those parts together, came up with this diagnosis of, "Aha, sea lions are being poisoned."

NARRATOR: The poison Gulland found in their bodies was a substance called domoic acid that is known to come from a certain kind of toxic algae.

For Gulland and team that was bad news. There is no known cure for domoic acid poison. And there had never been any known cases in California waters. So the urgent question was, "Where was it coming from?"

DAVID CARON (University of Southern California): This is epidemiology at its best. We are looking at an emerging disease, if you will.

NARRATOR: David Caron, an oceanographer at the University of Southern California, is an expert on ocean algae called phytoplankton, the single-cell organism that can be found in every teaspoon of seawater.

DAVID CARON: So, in your typical teaspoon of water, you will find something on the order of 50 million viruses, five million bacteria, several thousand micro-algae, or phytoplankton, and probably a similar amount of protozoa.

NARRATOR: Somewhere in all these millions of organisms was the killer. Caron and his lab team filter gallons of seawater weekly to try to isolate the particular variety of phytoplankton that produces domoic acid.

DAVID CARON: Domoic acid turns out to be a very powerful neurotoxin. It gets into the neural connections, and it mimics an electrical transmitter in the nerves of any higher organism. And it continues to fire those nerves until they, literally, burn out.

NARRATOR: Once the poison was isolated, the pieces fell quickly into place. It turned out that Gulland was seeing the effects of brain damage. Domoic acid was literally burning holes in the sea lions' brains.

Ever since those first cases, domoic acid has become an annual problem at the Marine Mammal Center. In late spring, it can be particularly intense, like with Sardine.

Sardine is exhibiting all the classic signs: bobbing head, non-responsive and seizures.

FELICIA NUTTER: So we'll do the E.E.G., and I expect we're going to find seizure activity.

NARRATOR: The key test for domoic acid poisoning is an E.E.G., or electroencephalogram.

FELICIA NUTTER: An E.E.G. allows us to measure electrical activity in the brain, and we can see seizure activity. The prognosis, for animals suffering the chronic effects of domoic acid, is poor.

NARRATOR: This understanding came, in part, from radio tags that were put on sea lions that had domoic acid poisoning but were returned to the wild.

FELICIA NUTTER: Our research has shown that their quality of life and behavior is abnormal, and usually, within a few months, they are probably going to die.

NARRATOR: So what causes these outbreaks of domoic acid poisoning? David Caron's work shows that human sewage and the runoff of fertilizers from farms increases phytoplankton in the ocean. This satellite map shows that connection.

DAVID CARON: You can see the coastline. So, Los Angeles is right up in here. And so what you're seeing here, this little colored, sort of grayish areas out here, are the flow from those rivers right after a storm.

NARRATOR: Caron has compared the location of this runoff with the concentration of phytoplankton in the water.

DAVID CARON: And you can see, kind of, coinciding with some of this plume of material coming out of the rivers, you can see this large amount of phytoplankton production that's taking place.

NARRATOR: What factors in this runoff are causing an increase in domoic acid is the question Caron is now trying to answer. And with each year, that question become more urgent.

DAVID CARON: In 2006, 2007 and now, in 2008, it has come back with a vengeance, all three years. And, in fact, the concentrations, that we have seen in the water, of the toxin domoic acid, have almost doubled from year to year, in those three years. It's dramatically affecting the animals that are present.

NARRATOR: Frighteningly, domoic acid can affect humans, too, because it's concentrated in filter-feeding fish, like sardines and mussels, which both people and sea lions like to eat.

The California Department of Health works with Caron and the Marine Mammal Center to monitor for domoic acid outbreaks.

FRANCES GULLAND: If humans ate domoic acid, they, too, would have similar symptoms. So what we learn from sea lions is relevant to the study of how domoic acid could impact human health, as well.

DAVID CARON: Right now, we still treat the oceans as this wild environment that can absorb anything we throw in it and anything we throw at it. I'm telling you, that's no longer true.

NARRATOR: And sea lions like Sardine are suffering the consequences. The damage clearly shows up on her E.E.G.

FELICIA NUTTER: So we've had less than a minute of recording, and I've already seen one seizure spike. Once we see that, we know that she is suffering from the chronic affects of domoic acid. Because of the seizure activity, the best option we can provide is humane euthanasia.

NARRATOR: As the spring progresses, the patients at the Marine Mammal Center begin to change over. The elephant seal pups that came in early are getting ready to leave. Our pup, Ouzel, has finally gotten the knack of fishing. Your Sister has gotten good and fat.

Increasingly, with each day, the new patients are sea lions, some with domoic acid seizures, some entangled in human garbage.

FELICIA NUTTER: He has a fishhook in his eyelid.

NARRATOR: Others are young pups who've not quite made it on their own.

Every year, close to 1,000 animals are treated here. Fortunately, in Northern California, sea lions, elephant seals and harbor seal populations are still relatively healthy and growing.

But that is not the case everywhere—like in the Hawaiian Islands. On the North Shore of Oahu, Jennifer Maldonado is setting up a protective barrier.

JENNIFER MALDONADO (Volunteer): I'll set up a sign. Well, we've tried to keep the location a secret. Oh, sorry I'm taking you a difficult path.

NARRATOR: Jennifer is part of an all-out effort to protect a very special mom and pup.

JENNIFER MALDONADO: They're still nursing.

NARRATOR: A few weeks ago, this Hawaiian monk seal hauled out on this beach to give birth to the little pup on the left.

Hawaiian monk seals are one of the most endangered animals in the world. Their Caribbean cousin was declared extinct earlier this year.

JENNIFER MALDONADO: We need to head this way, because we are really close to them.

NARRATOR: It is estimated that there are just under 1,200 Hawaiian monk seals left on Earth. With so few, each one becomes critical to the survival of the species.

JENNIFER MALDONADO: This is necessary, because if someone happens to come down and startles them, the mom can feel threatened and want to leave and not come back to the pup. It's just so special. The pup's rolling around right now, I can see.

NARRATOR: Recently, another Hawaiian monk seal pup was found, abandoned by its mother, on the island of Kauai. The pup was rescued, flown to Honolulu, and placed under quarantine in this National Marine Fisheries building.

Frances Gulland has flown in to help try and help save it.

FRANCES GULLAND: For me, it's very important to be here now and work with this animal. Every monk seal is really important to the survival of the species. The population is actually declining, at about 4 percent per year, so we have to do, really, everything we can, now.

NARRATOR: There has never been a newborn Hawaiian monk seal, this young, successfully rescued. Gulland hopes this time it will be different.

No one here is willing to take any chances, not even with our cameras.

Can we come in?

FRANCES GULLAND: I'm afraid not.

NARRATOR: Instead, we asked one of the staff there to film the midday feeding for us.

FRANCES GULLAND: We really want to minimize the pup's exposure to humans, for a variety of reasons. The first is quarantine. If you had a cold or if you had an eye infection, or something, he could be affected by that. The second reason is also his behavioral development. He has to go back to the wild. He has to behave like a wild monk seal. So we really want to minimize his exposure to people.

The Marine Mammal Center has learned a lot, by caring for thousands of harbor seal pups and elephant seal pups, over time. Some of those techniques are directly applicable, such as how to tube feed and how to wean animals from tubes onto fish. Some of them are a little different.

Monk seals like to forage on the bottom, and they'll turn rocks over to get their fish, so there are differences in the foraging behavior of these animals, which will result in differences in the way we get them to eat fish for the first time.

NARRATOR: After the midday tubing, we get another firsthand report.

FILM CREW MEMBER: How's he doing?

FRANCES GULLAND: He's doing great. He's putting on weight now. So, this is his body weight. So, you can see, over the past week, he is really beginning to gain weight. In fact, this week he put on two kilos. He's got a ways to go. He's got to grow and get fat.

By saving the monk seal, we can also save the habitat that they live in. So, for the people of Hawaii, this is really an animal that is important to the culture and to the environment here.

FELICIA NUTTER: When populations get to a certain level, there is sort of a tipping point you get to, where every individual matters. For every species that tipping point is a little bit different. One of the reasons we talk about the value of rehabilitation for common species is that we can learn how to do this with common species, so that, if we need to do it with threatened or endangered species, we can; we are not figuring it out for the first time, with animals that are in a really perilous situation.

Her clinical behavior is great. She is eating very well and not showing any clinical abnormalities.

FRANCES GULLAND: Well, then, she'll go, and there will be no more Your Sister jokes.

NARRATOR: Saving these animals depends upon understanding each species' unique biology and developing effective treatments. It is the daily routine that makes all the difference.

On the wall of Shelbi's office, there are class photos of the harbor seal pups that made to graduation day. This year's class would be the envy of any great art museum, it includes Matisse, Cezanne and Duchamp.

Our pup, Ouzel, the elephant seal, was released one day, unexpectedly, when the power went out, and the filters for the pools broke down. Gulland ordered all of the animals that were close to their release weight to go immediately. Ouzel and ten others were released together.

Your Sister was also released, with five other healthy elephant seals, at Point Reyes National Seashore. The staff is fond of saying, "Your Sister is, once again, wild."

Taxman, whose head was scarred by ocean trash, was spotted at the famous San Francisco tourist attraction, Pier 39. Obviously, he's still interested in hanging out near humans.

Xilia, the harbor seal with the mysterious medical problems, made a surprising turnaround and started eating live fish. So she was released with a data recorder. Sadly, it looks like Xilia got caught up in a fishing net and was dragged out to sea.

Duchamp is going home today, in what is the annual Full Moon Release Party. It's a night that many volunteers for the Marine Mammal Center celebrate.

MARINE MAMMAL CENTER VOLUNTEER 2: Are you guys ready? Okay, this is Duchamp.

NARRATOR: Undaunted by deadly hydrogen sulfide fumes, two explorers venture into the dark recesses of a wild cave. Inside, toxic gases bubble up through the stream. Gas monitors warn the cavers of concentrations that could kill in minutes.

LOUISE HOSE (Geologist, Chapman University): We'll have to keep an eye on that.

NARRATOR: Yet, to their amazement, everywhere they look, life is flourishing, unfazed by the poison in the air or relentless darkness.

Then the explorers make a discovery even more bizarre. Dangling from the ceiling are soft, gooey strings of mucus that drip like a runny nose. To their disbelief, dripping from the strange slime is caustic acid strong enough to dissolve the cave walls right before their eyes. Suddenly the gas monitor beeps incessantly.

DIANA NORTHUP (Microbial Ecologist, University of New Mexico): And then we happened to look at it and realized it's carbon monoxide that's going off. And our respirators don't protect against carbon monoxide. I mean this cave is just full of good ways to die.

NARRATOR: The explorers get out, but they are stunned! How are the creatures here able to live at life's edge in acid, toxic gases and darkness? What mysterious process is eating away this cave? And is it unique? Scattered across the earth over 50,000 caves have been found. Most have been formed by water. Others have been carved by flowing glaciers or sculpted from volcanic lava. But the origin of some caves remains a mystery. Today, explorers are penetrating further than ever into the depths of this underground universe, transforming our understanding of how caves and the hidden life within them began.

NARRATOR: Just beneath the surface of the earth lies a vast unknown wilderness—a world of timeless darkness and eerie silence; of vaulting halls and maze-like passages; of mineral formations so exquisite they seem sculpted for some great cathedral, yet have been taking form by themselves for eons. They bear names both exotic and whimsical: fishtails, draperies, bacon, stalagmites and stalactites.

PENNY BOSTON (Geomicrobiologist, University of New Mexico): It's such a different environment, it's almost like going to another planet. In a sense, it is another planet. It's the part of our own planet that we have not explored. Just like the deep oceans are something that's only become accessible to us in the last century or less, now we're finding that kind of pioneering effort going on in caves.

NARRATOR: The quest to understand one of the world's most mysterious caves began in the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico. Two hundred fifty million years ago, this range was a massive barrier reef called El Capitan. It lay beneath an inland sea covering the American Southwest. As the sea evaporated, the reef hardened into a rock called limestone. Over time the earth shifted, lifting the rocks 8,000 feet above the sea floor.

Deep inside this ancient reef lies the world-famous Carlsbad Caverns. Its most striking feature is the Big Room, 750 feet below the surface. It's large enough to hold over six football fields, and has ceilings as high as a 30-story building.

Geologists believed that the Big Room and all limestone caves were formed by rain and underground water penetrating cracks in the rocks. As the water absorbed carbon dioxide from the soil, it formed a weak carbonic acid, similar to a carbonated drink. Over millions of years, this flowing water dissolved the rock away leaving networks of underground chambers. But this theory of cave formation would be challenged by geologists working in Carlsbad's Big Room—among them Dave Jagnow and Carol Hill.

CAROL HILL (Geologist, University of New Mexico): There were a number of mysteries in the cave that we couldn't figure out. One is why are these caves so big? And why was there no place that it looked like the water had entered the caves and had gone out of the caves? The Big room just ends absolutely abruptly.

NARRATOR: But what else besides flowing water could have removed such a massive quantity of rock? And there were other riddles. Why were some rocks so full of holes they looked like Swiss cheese? And other rocks, 20 feet high and covered with mud, turned out to be something else entirely.

DAVID JAGNOW (Consulting Geologist): The most unusual thing we noticed on the floor of the Big Room were these massive blocks—100-ton blocks the size of houses—of gypsum, the mineral gypsum. And this is a mineral that is formed by evaporation of seawater. And in most caves you wouldn't expect to find gypsum because it's so easily dissolved, and I would have expected it to be flushed out of the cave here long ago by the water dripping into this cave.

NARRATOR: It would take years to unravel the mystery of these gypsum blocks. In the meantime, gypsum would be found in other Guadalupe Caves, including one discovered only a few miles away from Carlsbad. Following the sound of the wind to the bottom of a pit in Lechuguilla Canyon, three cavers uncovered an extraordinary place.

Deep inside, their lights illuminated a bizarre underworld glistening with gypsum crystals. Passageways snaked through tunnels encrusted with the snow-white mineral. In contrast to Carlsbad, every inch of Lechuguilla was covered by the most spectacular gypsum formations ever discovered. The most dazzling crystals were found in the Chandelier Ballroom, where delicate branches, 20 feet long, hung from the ceiling. Because Lechuguilla had been sealed from the surface, its gypsum remained sparkling white.

DAVID JAGNOW:	The gypsum is just beautifully preserved in Lechuguilla cave. But gypsum is a rare mineral to find in any cave, and yet these caves were full of these unique formations. And so that was another one of the clues that made us think these caves must have a very unique origin.

NARRATOR: Perhaps the gypsum had washed into the caves from the surrounding gypsum plains. Deposited by the ancient sea, these plains stretch for miles beside the Guadalupe Mountains. But when Carol analyzed Carlsbad's gypsum, she discovered it was chemically different from the plains. There was only one other way it could have been formed: when sulfuric acid reacts with limestone it dissolves, leaving gypsum behind.

DAVID JAGNOW:	Sulfuric acid is much more powerful than carbonic acid. It can dissolve out about eight times the volume that a normal cave would be as a result of carbonic acid solution. So it's much more powerful, but you very rarely find it in nature.

NARRATOR: Where could acid as caustic as that in a car battery have come from? Carol and Dave began to search for a source. They knew that around the Guadalupe Mountains lay major deposits of oil and gas thousands of feet underground. They also discovered that an undesirable chemical tainted these deposits.

DAVID JAGNOW:	These deposits are actually what we call "sour" because they contain hydrogen sulfide. And any time you drill a well around the Guadalupe Mountains, you smell this rotten egg smell. It's hydrogen sulfide gas.

CAROL HILL:	And I knew that if hydrogen sulfide mixed with oxygen it would create sulfuric acid. So that had to be the source.

NARRATOR: Carol knew that something deep within the oil fields was producing the hydrogen sulfide gas, but what? A chemical analysis revealed it bore the telltale signs of life. Something living was eating the oil and giving off hydrogen sulfide.

But what kind of life could survive at depths of 15,000 feet, where temperatures soared to 165 degrees Fahrenheit? Clues were found at Yellowstone National Park when biologists discovered bacteria growing in a hot spring at 176 degrees Fahrenheit. That was close to the boiling point of water, which scientists always assumed would destroy a living cell. But these organisms had a chemical structure that protected them from the heat.

ANNA-LOUISE REYSENBACH (Microbiologist, Portland State University): It's pretty surprising to think that microbes can actually grow under these conditions at these high temperatures. And I don't dare touch this hot water because it's so hot. The temperature is fluctuating, but it's about 180 degrees Fahrenheit. That, in Celsius, is 83 degrees Celsius. That's really hot! And water boils in Yellowstone at 93 degrees Celsius, so what you're seeing here is gas, gas bubbling out from deep within the earth.

NARRATOR: Scientists would soon discover an even harsher environment where microbes could survive. The revelation came when a research submarine stumbled on volcanic cracks in the seabed, spewing out minerals and chemicals. Around these cracks, colonies of microbes clumped together in thick mats lived in total darkness. Instead of using energy from the sun, they fed on chemicals and seemed undaunted by temperatures that far exceeded those of Yellowstone.

DAVID WOLFE (Author, Tales from the Underground): We discovered at these deep-sea hydrothermal vents, organisms living at temperatures—thriving at temperatures—well above boiling—230, 240 degrees Fahrenheit. And the reason they can do this is because the pressures are so great at that depth that the water's not actually boiling. So water is still in a liquid state. So it really proved the point that indeed life could thrive under some rather extreme conditions.

NARRATOR: These extraordinary microbes were nicknamed "extremophiles," because they could tolerate extremes of pressure, heat and darkness. As long as there was water and a chemical source of energy, life could indeed survive deep beneath the surface of the earth. But could it set in motion the formation of a cave?

Back at Carlsbad, geologists proposed a simple but radical theory. Tiny microbes, feeding on oil far beneath the cave, produced hydrogen sulfide gas as a product of their metabolism. The gas seeped up into the Capitan Reef where it mixed with oxygen in the ground water and formed sulfuric acid. The acid ate away vast amounts of limestone, carving out the caves and leaving gypsum behind. It all made sense, but at first geologists were skeptical.

CAROL HILL:	Everyone for 100 years had just assumed that it was only carbonic acid which carves out caves. Nobody had even thought of sulfuric acid being the agent by which this cave and the other caves in the Guadalupe Mountains could have formed. It was a completely new idea.

NARRATOR: And a startling concept. Biology, not just geology, was at work. Life itself was helping to shape the world beneath our feet.

Back at Lechuguilla, a team of microbiologists get ready to rappel into the cave to hunt for this hidden life. Only a small number of scientists dare to enter this underground wilderness. Among them is Diana Northup.

DIANA NORTHUP:	For some people it's easy. For me it's an incredibly difficult cave to go into because I'm afraid of heights and Lechuguilla is pits. It's just one hole after another. But what draws me is the fact that there is incredible science to be done in this cave. It is full of scientific mysteries.

NARRATOR: At the bottom of the pit, Diana climbs through the hatch door that protects the cave. As the air pressure changes, winds can blow though the entrance tunnel at speeds up to 50 miles per hour. Once inside, she will be plunged into absolute darkness and totally dependent on battery-powered lights.

DIANA NORTHUP:	When the door slams, all the wind shuts off, and so this wind tunnel that you've been in just comes down to a murmur. And then as you move away from it, the cave becomes completely silent. So you get no concept of what's around you, because you're just sort of sitting in there in a bubble of blackness.

NARRATOR: Next, microbiologist Penny Boston rappels into the pit.

PENNY BOSTON:	I had done a lot of extreme environment work in surface environments. But I had never caved before—in a wild cave. And so Lechuguilla was my introduction to caving. And the first couple of times I went on trips there, I kept thinking, "All I have to do is live long enough to get out, and then I never have to come back." And that is what kept me going long enough to actually, sort of, endure it. And after those first couple of trips, when all I wanted to do was get out, the beauties of the cave and the sense of otherworldliness that I got really soaked into my soul.

NARRATION: Lechuguilla is the deepest known cave in the continental United States and the world's fourth longest. Over 100 miles have been mapped in this underground labyrinth. Names of places like Freak-out Traverse, Death Pit and Chasm Drop reflect the challenge of this underground terrain. One of the hardest hurdles is to descend Boulder Falls.

DIANA NORTHUP:	Correct rigging says that you rig it so that you have to get onto the rope at the very edge of this pit. You have a safety to help you, but for me, who's afraid of heights, that's not a lot of comfort. And it's a 150-foot drop that is against the wall for a little way and then free. So as you come down this you are just hanging out in space.

NARRATOR: Boulder Falls is named after all the rocks that came loose the first time explorers ventured down. To reach the bottom, Penny and Diana lower themselves on a single rope tied to an anchor and control their speed with a hand brake. If they don't apply enough friction, they could spiral into an uncontrollable deadly descent.

At the bottom, the team begins the arduous climb down to the lower depths of the cave, where they will begin their hunt for hidden life. Although it's hard to imagine anything living in this barren, rocky terrain, all the necessary ingredients for microbial life are here. Lechuguilla is rich in chemicals they can eat like sulfur, manganese and iron, and, with 100 percent humidity, has plenty of water.

PENNY BOSTON:	The past 30 years has seen a really major revolution in microbiology. Partly this is because we have now tools where we can study these little tiny guys that we couldn't study before. But also because we have begun to realize that wherever we seem to look, where there's energy sources for them to live on, we actually find life forms, and that maybe they are not really obvious and maybe you have to look really hard, but they exist.

NARRATOR: Penny and Diana wonder if odd formations hanging from the ceiling could be fossilized bacteria. They call them "u-loops" and take a sample to study back in the lab. Lechuguilla is considered a dead cave because it's no longer being etched out by sulfuric acid, but this doesn't mean that it's devoid of life. Although the microbes that set in motion the cave's formation are long gone, Penny and Diana believe that others have taken their place. They decide to investigate why the walls are decaying and covered by rust-colored patches.

PENNY BOSTON:	The walls of the cave still seem to be enlarging. And what has happened, we believe, since the cave finished forming, is that there are other populations of microorganisms that can use other energy sources in the parent bedrock, and they might be actively participating in the breakdown of this material.

NARRATOR: To test this theory, Penny and Diana place chemicals on the walls that will react if they come in contact with living microbes. Where they get hits they collect samples. Back in the lab they hope to prove that bacteria are here, making a living in this extreme environment.

DIANA NORTHUP:	When you go into a cave and shut that door or get beyond the entrance zone, there is no sunlight. So the normal system that we think about fueling life is not there. Now, in other caves, they have rivers that run through them that bring in carcasses or dead leaves or twigs and things like that that can fuel microbial processes. That doesn't occur in Lechuguilla. You have a system that has only isolated pools, not rivers or streams, and so it's a very low-nutrient environment, and that makes it more extreme.

NARRATOR: If these samples show that extremophiles are surviving here, far from the life-giving sun, they must be getting their energy by eating minerals in the rocks.

After eight exhausting hours, the team reaches Lake Labarge. They're a thousand feet below the entrance and over a mile in. Protected from surface contamination, the lake is so pristine that at certain angles its water seems almost invisible. Although the cavers can safely drink from the lake, all of their food must be carried in. Everything about the human presence poses a threat to the cave.

DIANA NORTHUP:	We have a huge impact on caves by the very fact that we go in and bring ourselves. Now this may seem like a foreign concept, but as we walk through a cave we shed tens of thousands of skin fragments a minute. So you are a veritable little snowstorm and around you is this pile of debris. Your hair is falling out and littering the cave.

NARRATOR: But the greatest contamination comes from the necessity to camp underground for days.

DIANA NORTHUP:	And that means you're eating and dropping food crumbs, which to you are just crumbs, but to a microorganism it's as through you dropped a supermarket on top of their head.

PENNY BOSTON:	These organisms have been living in this really low-energy environment where food has really been hard to come by. They are adapted to that. When you overfeed them by giving them these sources of contamination you can really change the balance of who's there. Some organisms are actively poisoned, and so you are really mucking up the environment.

NARRATOR: Urine is left in designated places, but solid waste and trash have to be carried out. To conserve precious batteries for the long trek back, everyone turns in early. Since there's no difference between day and night, some find it hard to sleep—a reminder, perhaps, of how out of place humans are in this underground world.

PENNY BOSTON:	The idea of an extreme environment has been very useful to us, because it has pushed us to look at environments where we wouldn't have imagined at one time that there would be living things. But it really is a human-centered idea. We think of anything that we wouldn't be comfy in as an extreme environment. But from the point of view of the organisms that live there this is home. So for them it's not extreme; it's only extreme for us. And so we have to expand our view of conditions within which we now understand that life can exist.

NARRATOR: But does life exist in Lechuguilla cave? Back in the lab, Penny and Diana examine their samples with an electron microscope.

DIANA NORTHUP:	Scanning electron microscopy allows you to see incredibly tiny things. And we spend hours and hours lost among the sand grains, you know, as we just sort of cruise with the electron beam from particle to particle, hunting. And it's very hard sometimes, because there are minerals that look like microorganisms. So we use size and certain cellular structures or dividing cells or things to say, "These are actual cells."

NARRATOR: Magnified a hundred thousand times, the images reveal the extreme life that thrives in Lechuguilla's darkness. Here, tiny microbes appear as distinct circular shapes. Many appear firmly attached to the rocks.

DIANA NORTHUP:	We found a really exciting thing when we looked at some samples and saw what looks like a string of pearls that are widely spaced. And these are shapes that have been seen in other cave samples, once we search the literature, and they're consistently found in all the corrosion residues.

NARRATOR: Penny and Diana hope to figure out exactly how the microbes are enlarging the cave walls. They find clues in a rock sample rich with the mineral manganese.

DIANA NORTHUP:	What we're able to see is a very unique cell shape with an elongated tail that is associated with some bacteria that eat manganese. And manganese-eating bacteria are able to produce acid, which could be part of the corroding of this rock. Also, as they pull the manganese out of the rock wall to eat it, they're also leaving holes in the crystal lattice. So these two pieces together provide some of the evidence that we have that microbes are actually eating the rock walls.

NARRATOR: To be sure, they need to grow their samples in the lab, but less than one percent of all microbes can be cultured with standard techniques.

PENNY BOSTON:	In many of the cases, we are looking at organisms that are so different from any living, known organisms, that we have to guess what these guys even eat. Is it a metal? How much do they want? If we add sugar to the medium, are we killing a whole bunch of them? Well, it's a very laborious and slow process to sort of work this out.

NARRATOR: For microbes that won't grow in culture, Diana extracts DNA to figure out who is there.

DIANA NORTHUP:	Some of the organisms that I'm finding in Lechuguilla Cave, they are very, very dissimilar to any other known organism. We know them only because of their gene sequences, and they're incredibly diverse.

NARRATOR: But Lechuguilla's rock-eating bugs have one important trait in common.

PENNY BOSTON:	They need very little, and yet they aren't inactive. Originally we thought that perhaps many of the organisms that we might find would be either dead or just shut down metabolically. But what we have found is that there are very large numbers of these guys actually active, metabolically active and reproductive. And so, to me, that was one of the most amazing things.

NARRATOR: If microbes are still eating the walls of a cave as old as Lechuguilla, what role might they be playing in a younger cave still forming?

News of just such a cave draws Diana Northup and geologist Louise Hose to the lush rainforests of southern Mexico. They've made the journey in the hopes of catching a cave in the act of being formed. As they approach, they discover that the stream that runs through the cavern is milky white, rich with sulfur and gypsum. Hydrogen sulfide gas bubbles up in the water, a sure sign that the cave poses a deadly, invisible risk to anyone who dares to enter.

LOUISE HOSE:	The hydrogen sulfide combines with the moisture, the humidity, in the cave and forms sulfuric acid. And that sulfuric acid is in the air, and you breathe it into your lungs, and it will start to deteriorate the linings of the lungs. So we wear these gas masks to help filter out the hydrogen sulfide, and that's protecting my lungs from the sort of damage that can be done.

NARRATOR: Because of the toxic gases, few venture beyond the stone staircase that descends to the mouth of the cave. Diana and Louise carefully follow the stream that pierces the heart of Cueva de Villa Luz, which means lighted house in Spanish. It's named for the many skylights that connect the cave to the surface. But this influx of fresh air is no match for the deadly gases seeping into the cave.

As in Carlsbad, the hydrogen sulfide bubbling up in the stream is made by microbes deep underground. In addition to this gas, Louise and Diana's monitors detect other poisonous fumes.

DIANA NORTHUP:	Like what?

LOUISE HOSE:	Sometimes you have hydrogen fluoride.

DIANA NORTHUP:	What do those do to you?

LOUISE HOSE:	Kill you.

NARRATOR: As they venture further into the black recesses of the cave, their monitors beep incessantly, signaling a rise in gas levels. But despite the increasing darkness and toxic fumes, they find more life.

DIANA NORTHUP:	Usually, when you walk into a cave, life is something that you have to look pretty hard to see. And so the thing that just strikes you, just slaps you in the face in Via Luz, is the fact that everywhere you look there's life: there's spiders, there's insects. And, as you go deeper into the cave and into the dark areas, there are rocks in the stream that are covered with this green coating. It's not being driven by sunlight—it has to be driven by other things. So you think about, "Wow, what's really driving this system?"

NARRATOR: Deep inside the cave they find clues. Diana is mesmerized by strange formations dangling from the ceiling. At first glance they look like stalactites, but unlike stalactites, which are hardened limestone, these are soft, gooey strings of mucus. Because they drip like a runny nose, they're nicknamed "snottites." Diana is struck by how similar they look to u-loop rock formations found in Lechuguilla.

DIANA NORTHUP:	You can imagine that one snottite maybe went over and touched its neighbor and then became rock over time—it became calcified—and so possibly snottites existed all those millions of years ago when Lechuguilla was formed.

NARRATOR: But there is something else amazing about this slime.

LOUISE HOSE:	The liquid that is dripping off the end of each of the snottites is sulfuric acid. If you get it on your hands—I've had it drop in my eyes—it burns tremendously. Clothing will tend to dissolve when we have it drip on our clothes. When it drops onto the rocks, it helps to form the cave by dissolving away the limestone.

NARRATOR: The scientists are shocked. Not only are microbes beneath the cave producing hydrogen sulfide, it forms sulfuric acid as it bubbles up in the stream—bacteria inside the cave are making acid. Diana examines a snottite.

DIANA NORTHUP:	When you look at them with the microscope and look at them magnified many, many times, they're just enormous bacterial colonies. And when I looked at the DNA from one of these snottites, it's just this thriving culture of a bacteria that is known to eat sulfur and produce sulfuric acid.

NARRATOR: Wherever sulfuric acid eats away the limestone, pasty white gypsum is left behind. Finally, scientists can observe microbes in the act of creating a cave.

DIANA NORTHUP:	When you look at this cave, the walls are literally melting. It's like a birthday cake, left out in the rain, that's sort of melted. And so it just cries out to you that this is an enlargement process, because the walls are literally being dissolved before your eyes.

NARRATOR: But is life as powerful a force as the flowing water shaping the cave? Although the scientists are not sure, one thing is clear: these microbes play a vital role.

LOUISE HOSE:	And in these snottites, not only are there bacteria, but when we looked at them closely we found that there were mites and worms and other little tiny bugs and insects that were probably grazing off of the bacteria.

DIANA NORTHUP:	And right beside this snottite, which is so like battery acid, there's spiders with egg cases. And there isn't just one spider, there's gobs of spiders. So the whole wall is alive, not just with microorganisms, but with some of these insects and arachnids, that you wonder, "How could they survive here? There's all this hydrogen sulfide. This ought to be affecting them, too."

NARRATOR: But this gas bubbling up from below not only drives the cave's formation, it helps fuel the food chain of this subterranean world. Cut off from the sunlight, bacteria feast on the hydrogen sulfide, and, in turn, become food for the insects and fish.

Suddenly the oxygen in the cave plummets to deadly levels.

LOUISE HOSE:	There's a 10 percent drop in oxygen. You know we've seen it go from 20 and a half...

DIANA NORTHUP:	Wow, 10 percent!

LOUISE HOSE:	When you start to drop below 18 or 19, one worries. When it gets down to about nine and a half percent, it will kill you very rapidly, so we have to evacuate the area.

NARRATOR: The expedition ends abruptly, with many unanswered questions about the physical limits of life and its impact on caves.

The search for a cave that's easier to study leads a new group of scientists to northern Wyoming. Hidden on a rocky embankment is the entrance to Lower Kane Cave. From its narrow opening flows the familiar rotten smell of hydrogen sulfide fumes. Because the gas levels here are much lower than at Villa Luz, microbiologist Annette Summers-Engel and geologist Phil Bennett find Kane a safer place to work. Even sliding through its 30-inch crack is a relatively easy feat by caving standards.

Lower Kane has none of the exquisite mineral formations of Carlsbad or Lechuguilla, or the abundance of life of Villa Luz. Its gypsum-coated walls enclose three spring-fed pools linked by a stream that runs through the middle. The ceilings lack even the humblest stalactite. Yet this plain looking cave holds another treasure that has drawn these scientists underground for days on end.

Deep inside Kane's dark realm, the researchers have discovered a rare microbial world. Although the microbes themselves can't be seen, their colonies can. Just below the surface of Kane's springs, stretch tapestries woven by trillions of microbes banding together. This stringy matting, changing from subtle shades of blue-black, gold and brown, to garish Day-Glo orange, offers a glimpse of what early life might have looked like. Ancient rock records reveal that the earth was once covered with microbial mats like these. As life evolved, predators wiped them out. But, unlike Villa Luz, little else survives here so the microbes dominate. Since energy from the sun never reaches Kane, Phil Bennett tries to determine what chemicals in the water the microbes are feeding upon.

PHIL BENNETT (Geologist, University of Texas): Well, these bacteria don't actually use the sunlight for anything. What I mean by that is that they don't use carbon from trees or from things that were growing on the surface that came down in the cave and they're eating it. They're actually eating chemicals, chemicals that may not have ever needed sunlight to be produced. And so they're true dark life. They not only don't use light, but they never needed it at all.

NARRATOR: Just as at Villa Luz, hydrogen sulfide produced by microbes deep in the earth bubbles up though the spring and forms sulfuric acid. On the walls above, tiny droplets gleam in the light. They seem like ordinary condensation. But a needle-like probe reveals that the droplets are sulfuric acid. Although it's not as strong as the acid at Villa Luz, it's still dissolving away Kane's limestone and leaving gypsum behind. And like at Villa Luz, colonies of bacteria are making this acid. But how much did they shape the cave?

PHIL BENNETT:	The bacteria may be doing the things that would appear to have made the cave, but also the cave may have been formed without bacteria and they are living here. And that's the specific question that we're trying to answer: did the bacteria do all this or did this all happen and they just moved in because it was a great spot to live?

NARRATOR: The scientists devise a test of elegant simplicity. Chips of pure calcite, the mineral in limestone, are placed in plastic tubes and submerged in the springs beside the microbial mats. In some, both acidic water and microbes are allowed to flow freely over the limestone chip. In others, water is allowed in, but a fine filter keeps out the microbes.

After submerging the chips in the spring for several months, the team studies them beneath a microscope. The difference is striking. The chip exposed both to the microbes and acidic water is far more eroded. Colonies of microbes have left scars across the surface. But the chip only exposed to acidic water hardly seems changed.

PHIL BENNETT:	So if we had an absolutely sterile cave, would we see hydrogen sulfide converting to sulfuric acid? And the answer is, "Yes, but not very fast." When we have bacteria living off that hydrogen sulfide, producing sulfuric acid, it is much faster, we think, and more efficient, and so the cave formation process is very rapid.

PENNY BOSTON:	We now know that microbes are not just along for the ride when it comes to caves and the subsurface in general—that they're active agents of geological change over time. This is really a new perspective, that the organisms and the geology cannot be separated over time. And to understand caves, we have to understand the life that they contain. And if we had a planet with no life on it, the caves that would form would be very different from the ones that we have on this planet. And that magic ingredient that we have here, that has to be figured out, is life.

NARRATOR: To understand the full impact of life on Kane Cave, Annette and her colleagues have spent years analyzing its microbial mats. To their surprise, instead of simple colonies, they contain communities as diverse as a city block.

ANNETTE SUMMERS ENGEL (Geomicrobiologist, University of Texas): Traditionally it's been thought that many of these mats are composed of one type of organism. But we're finding in these mats, after studying them for several years, that they're composed of a wide range of microorganisms using iron, using sulfur, using carbon in different ways. And we never really thought that that would be possible. And each one of the mats has a different assemblage of microorganisms doing specific things for the cave.

NARRATOR: There are microbes eating hydrogen sulfide, making sulfuric acid and dissolving the limestone. Below them are bugs that live off the waste of the rock-eaters, making methane gas or even possibly new minerals. But the greatest surprise is the discovery of a primitive extremophile closely related to those found thousands of miles away at undersea volcanic vents. There are hints that these organisms descend directly from the earliest forms of life that emerged on Earth some 3.5 billion years ago.

DAVID WOLFE:	There is a growing consensus that life probably began in the subsurface environments where organisms would have been safeguarded from the rather horrendous conditions going on at the surface at the time, with meteor bombardments, volcanic eruptions, high ultraviolet radiation loads. So surface life really, quite possibly evolved from subsurface life and not the other way around.

NARRATOR: If extremophiles represent ancient life, they also give us a glimpse of how this life survived here on earth and perhaps elsewhere.

PHIL BENNETT:	Life can live off simple chemical compounds. And what's important about that is...is in early life and perhaps in other environments or other planets, that's all there is. So when we look at the bacteria in Kane and how they're living off of simple elements, this may be how bacteria are living on Europa, for example, or on Mars.

NARRATOR: Both astronomers and geologists believe that other planets and moons in our solar system have subsurface conditions similar to Earth's. If extremophiles can survive in harsh environments here, why not beneath the surface of some distant planetary body where liquid water exists?

PENNY BOSTON:	We have found organisms in more places than we could have ever dreamed. And so, by looking at the extremes of what life can do on our planet, we may be looking at a condition that's representative of the average condition on another planet. And it helps us to be able to stretch our imaginations and figure out just how to go about looking for life elsewhere in the universe.

NARRATOR: It's hard to imagine a more alien, exotic world than the underground realm of caves. While their sculpted beauty is breathtaking, the invisible dark life they contain is even more extraordinary. These microbes, with their unique strategies for survival, raise the possibility that there is far more life in the universe than we ever imagined. And on earth, much of it remains undiscovered beneath our feet.

DIANA NORTHUP:	We can't see microbes, and so therefore, we tend to dismiss them. But they are not only active, they're powerful. They carve out caves. They're why we're not up to our necks in dead trees and plants. They produce even the very air that we breathe. Without them we'd be nothing. They actually really are the engineers of our planet. They are worthy of our respect.

NARRATOR: Tonight, on NOVA, lives were imperiled, fortunes spent, to possess a precious gem plucked from the sea. For centuries, its mystique centered on the mystery of its origins: an accident of nature, or a product of human engineering?

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: For this particular lot of shells, everything went right.

NARRATOR: Has science unlocked the secret of the perfect pearl?

__: Major funding for NOVA is provided by the PARK Foundation, dedicated to education and quality television. And by Iomega, makers of personal storage solutions for your computer, so you can create more, save more, share more, and do more of whatever it is you do. Iomega, because it's your stuff. This program is funded in part by Northwestern Mutual Life, which has been protecting families and businesses for generations. Have you heard from the quiet company? Northwestern Mutual Life. And by, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and viewers like you.

NARRATOR: Of all of the world's gems, it is the pearl which has held the greatest fascination for humans. So powerful is the pearl's allure, that for thousands of years, people have risked their lives to rest this perfect jewel from the ocean's depths. Today's cultured pearls are produced in their millions in a remarkable collusion between nature and science.

NARRATOR: But as science continues to perfect the techniques for pearl culturing, nature is not always a willing partner.

NARRATOR: Pearl oysters are sensitive creatures, susceptible to even subtle changes in the environment. They are a member of the mollusk family, one of the most successful species on earth. Mollusks have been around for at 530 million years, and have evolved into over 130,000 living species.

NARRATOR: All types of mollusks can produce something resembling a pearl, but relatively few species create the lustrous objects we prize as gems.

NARRATOR: The quest to uncover the secrets of the pearl oyster has been a lifelong passion for zoologist John Lucas, an international mollusk expert.

JOHN LUCAS: This is the body of the pearl oyster. There's the inside of the shell, the lustrous nacre or the shiny bit that make the pearl oyster. And one of the most dominant things is this large muscle here, which pulls the two shells together, so that when you try to pull it apart, this muscle resists. And these do have predators, fish and crabs and things that try to break them apart, and the animal depends on that adductor muscle to hold the shells together and resist the predator.

Oysters are found all over the world. Many of them are found in estuaries and, typically, the ocean, but pearl oysters are more tropical animals. What oysters like is a place where there is lots of algae in the water, because they are filter feeders; they just sit there filtering water all of the time and getting algae cells from the water. So they're really looking for a spot where the water has lots of food for them, so there are good currents, and things like that.

NARRATOR: Currents also carry foreign material which can enter the shell. Normally, the oyster can expel any irritant that finds its way inside. But sometimes a piece of shell or coral catches in its delicate flesh. If it can't get rid of this foreign matter, the oyster isolates it inside a membrane or pearl sack that secretes nacre, the same smooth substance called mother of pearl that lines its shell. The irritant is slowly plated with translucent layers of calcium carbonate crystals, which make the irritant smooth and tolerable to the oyster.

KRISTIN JOYCE: Pearls cast a glow. There is a property that's called orient, a manner in which the pearl actually casts light. And this is the essence of pearls.

KRISTIN JOYCE: You're speaking about a gemstone that's pure and perfect, as it's plucked from a mollusk, from an oyster. One can only imagine how amazing it must have been for the first man, for the first woman, to discover this, have no idea whether they should worship it, eat it, wear it. But shamans, and the mystics, and the alchemists, and early man, who is worshipping the sun and the moon, would have been drawn to something like pearls, like no other stone.

NARRATOR: Throughout history, the pearl has been passionately sought after by kings and queens, emperors, and maharajahs. As valued in the West as in the East, pearls proclaim their owner's wealth and power, and were often the currency of romance.

__: I should love to have a man dive twenty fathoms to bring me up a pearl.

__: And if I were that man, what then?

__: Then, I might be very kind to you.

NARRATOR: Even after the introduction of underwater breathing systems, diving for pearls remained dangerous and unpredictable. Shark attacks and accidents took their toll, along with the diver's disease known as the bends, where nitrogen bubbles form in the blood stream.

NARRATOR: Sometimes divers were forced to dive too deep, or stay below too long. The human passion for pearls took a heavy toll.

NARRATOR: Natural pearls are always rare, exquisite accidents of nature. And when discovered, they're almost never perfectly round. They come in an infinite variety of shapes. Formations, bumps, and half-domes, that grow against the shell's interior surface are called mabes.

NARRATOR: Some pearls grow into irregular and, sometimes, fantastic forms called baroques. A baroque is created when an oyster is unable to turn the foreign object inside its shell, causing the layering of nacre to build up unevenly.

NARRATOR: The mystique of the pearl centered on the mystery of its origins.

FRED WARD: There are several instances in history where people actually wondered how these pearls came into existence naturally, and if they could do anything to induce an oyster to make a pearl on command.

NARRATOR: The first known example of pearl culturing came in the 12th century, when the Chinese produced little pearl Buddhas by sliding figurines into freshwater mussels between the body and the shell. The practice of inducing mollusks to make pearls goes back more than 1,500 years.

NARRATOR: As early as the 5th century, the Chinese produced pearls by inserting small objects, including images of Buddha, between the shell of a freshwater mussel and its nacre-producing mantle.

FRED WARD: And that technology never got out of China. It now seems relatively simple. This is not rocket science. It's a relatively simple process, in fact. But it baffled people for at least hundreds of years, and maybe thousands.

NARRATOR: It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that a technique for culturing pearls was invented in Japan. At last, the natural process could be duplicated.

NARRATOR: The essential discovery was made by the son of a noodle shop owner, Kokichi Mikimoto. After twenty years of exhaustive research and many disappointments, he founded Japan's cultured pearl industry.

FRED WARD: Mikimoto's dream was not just to make a pearl; his dream was to make a round pearl. He knew the world wanted and would buy a round pearls, if you could make rounds on demand. So it took a long time. He tried every conceivable product that he could grind and make into a sphere to push into an oyster to see if he could induce it to coat it and make a pearl -- soap, wood, metal, glass -- until he finally found a product that did. It was a sphere made out of a freshwater mussel shell, which happened to come from the United States.

NARRATOR: Mikimoto had discovered a natural irritant which the oyster wouldn't reject. But these implanted beads were still not being consistently coated with nacre. Another ingredient was needed. Fortunately, two other Japanese experimenters found the answer, which Mikimoto would later license.

FRED WARD: And the secret turned out to be that the thing that would induce an oyster to coat the foreign object is a small piece of mantle tissue from another oyster. Once you sacrifice one oyster, you cut the lip -- the mantle tissue -- into small pieces, make a slit in the oysters, put in the foreign object, and put in a little piece of tissue -- bingo, the secret is now revealed. That's what makes a cultured pearl.

NARRATOR: In this procedure called nucleation, mantle tissue from another oyster induces the formation of a pearl sack around the irritant bead. That pearl sack then secretes nacre, and, over a period of time, produces a cultured pearl.

NEWSREEL: Under these waters, there is a king's ransom in cultured pearls forming around the previously planted beads, and Mikimoto's famous girl divers go down for the harvest.

NARRATOR: Mikimoto also invented a system for farming oysters. His divers gathered wild akoya oysters, which thrived in the sheltered coastal waters of Japan. Once they'd been nucleated, the oysters were caged and suspended from rafts and left to grow for four years, to produce a thick coating of nacre.

NEWSREEL: Now begins the search for the pearls themselves, and the haul is a rich one. From an irritant planted in the oyster, a pearl is born. And on Mikimoto's farm, a bumper crop is harvested. Sparkling gems for export, prosperity for Japan.

NARRATOR: Mikimoto wasn't just a remarkable innovator. He was also a brilliant business man and promoter. He worked tirelessly to have his cultured pearls accepted as true gems.

FRED WARD: He actually made the world accept the product as pearls, without a disclaimer about them, that they were almost pearls, or man-made pearls, or anything of that sort. The word "cultured pearl" became accepted, legal, and satisfactory all around the world.

NEWSREEL: Glamorous Gloria Swanson, well guarded, arrives at the Waldorf, wearing the world's most expensive gown. The dress is covered with 100,000 cultured pearls. It is worth $100,000 dollars, and weighs thirty pounds, as Miss Swanson can tell you.

KRISTIN JOYCE: What was remarkable about Mikimoto was that he was truly a marketing genius. He had the ability to take his discovery, so to speak, beyond the borders of Asia, into Europe, and the United States. And I think because he brought pearls to the masses, in so many different forms, and was able to offer them at various prices, that he changed the face of pearls, in terms of jewelry.

NARRATOR: Mikimoto invented the process for culturing pearls in Japan's Ago Bay. Today, dozens of large pearl companies cultivate oysters in the bay.

NARRATOR: Small oysters, like the akoya, usually cannot tolerate nucleation more than once. Most will be killed during harvesting when the pearls are separated from the flesh.

NARRATOR: The Japanese Akoya, Pinctada imbricata,

produces pearls between two and ten millimeters in size, the industry standard for many decades.

FRED WARD: The other side of that story is that, first of all, the Mikimoto company perceived this as their secret. As the decades went on, other people, other Japanese companies were, because people do talk, discovering the secret. But, the Japanese tried to make it the Japanese secret, that no one else should know how to culture. No one should know where to place the bead. No one should know about the mantle tissue addition. They wanted it to be a national treasure. And they successfully did that by making their workers swear that they would not reveal it to other people. It was a long held secret.

FRED WARD: So when they would go out into other countries, like Burma, or, ultimately, into Australia, it was always with Japanese technicians. It was always with an entire contingent of folks to come and do the process to nucleate the oysters, and to harvest the oysters, and to take the product back to Japan to sell. So it was a virtual global monopoly.

NARRATOR: Japan's pearling industry expanded beyond its boarders to other Pacific shores in search of larger South Sea oysters. In the late 1950s, the Japanese arrived in Australia, helping to establish the countries first cultured pearl farm in the Kimberly region.

NARRATOR: Australia is home to the Pinctada Maxima, the world's largest oyster, producer of the biggest and most expensive pearls. It can live up to twenty years, growing to the size of a dinner plate.

Long before the arrival of pearl culturing methods, these mighty mollusks were harvested for their precious mother of pearl.

Throughout the century, they formed the basis for Australia's pearl shell industry.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: In the 1800s, late 1800s, when the Australian pearl beds were first discovered, it was only a matter of two or three years after the discovery before these beds were supplying the world, the whole world, with 75 percent of the world's shell requirements, you know, for buttons, inlay, knife handles, gun handles, all these sort of things.

NARRATOR: The environment in this remote region proved ideal for sustaining a large, healthy population of pearl oysters.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: This Eighty Mile Beach area, this has the world's most unique, fantastic shell beds. There's no other shell bed like this in the world. It's unique because it has this fabulously clean Indian Ocean.

NARRATOR: These shell beds are swept by an exceptionally high tidal flow, providing the oysters an abundant supply of food.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: So the only place that oysters will really proliferate is where you've got an abundance of plankton, so you need a rich ocean, you need a tide carrying the plankton to the oyster, because the oyster can't move, it's a filter animal, so it doesn't do very well if it's competing for plankton. Eighty Mile Beach has got all of that, but, at the same time, it has sand and silt coverage, which prevents other creatures from growing. And you have a unique situation where the tides run in-shore and out-shore, northwest, southeast. And so what you have is spawnings are carried from each reef, across the reefs, back in shore, and then out across these things and so you get a continual regeneration of the shell stocks.

NARRATOR: Nick Paspaley now runs a modern pearl culturing operation along these shores. His father began the business in the 1930s, harvesting oysters long before the arrival of Japanese culturing methods. In those days, gem quality pearls were rare, and the business of the day was in the profit the shells could bring.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: All my father ever did really, was live pearling, and so it was sort of a big part of my life. All my childhood experiences were out in luggers, and with my father at the shell sheds, and down in the engine rooms, and things. I remember, as a little guy, the hours that my father and some of the other pearlers would stand around the veranda, with a couple of pearls in their hand, and I don't know what they spoke about, but they'd be there for hours discussing this particular pearl. And they just had a passion for pearls, and the industry, that's all they knew. And, to them, there was nothing else outside of that world.

But perfectly round pearls were very, very rare. In my father's whole lifetime as a pearler, he wouldn't have been able to put one string of perfect pearls together.

NARRATOR: Nick's father became one of the first Australians to move into pearl culturing, and, in 1958, he established a farm with Japanese and American partners.

NARRATOR: Oysters were gathered in the wild. But instead of killing the oysters for their shells, the live animals were transported to sheltered bays and used as raw stock to cultivate pearls. Japanese technicians were employed to make use of their proven, but still secret culturing techniques. The Japanese also brought their oyster farming methods.

NARRATOR: They crowded together the large Australian shells, 5,000 or more, suspended from a single pontoon. But disaster struck. 60 percent of the oysters died, and those that survived produced only a few gems quality pearls. Clearly, Paspaley would have to find new methods.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: The first thing he did with me when I came back from university was send me out to the pearl farm to solve some of the problems. And one of the biggest problems was that the systems they were using were the Japanese systems. They were fine for the Japanese shell, but they were unsuitable for the Australian shell. When I was diving, picking up pearl shells, I could see the difference immediately between the health of those shells and their appearance and the shells in the pearl farm situation. So, my ambition was to keep all pearl shells in the same condition that they were in when I found them.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: Well, the Japanese shell is much hardier than the Australian shell. It will live under much higher concentrations. It requires less plankton, its stress levels are much higher. The Australian shell will not respond in the same manner as the Japanese shell to the same treatment. And to clean the shells, what you had to do, you had a team of workers that physically went to the raft, pulled up the baskets, tipped them out of the baskets, and they got to work with tomahawks and chopped all the barnacles off.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: Soon, it became obvious to me that, by three months, the shell was close to death and the shell never had a chance to produce a pearl.

NARRATOR: Unable to roll in the surf, captive oysters quickly become smothered by barnacles. To avoid this, oysters were winched onboard and put through cleaning machines every few weeks. The oysters' health did improve. But other problems remained. The harbor water was becoming less pristine and overcrowding was a growing concern.

Ten years of experimentation led to a simple, but expensive, solution:

To take the entire pearl culturing operation out to sea.

NARRATOR: Now, every year from June till September, Australian crews and Japanese technicians live and work in an environment more beneficial to the health of the oysters. This floating enterprise is a high-tech solution to the threat of oyster mortality. But it is a solution few can afford.

NARRATOR: In Japan, pearl farmers are also struggling with the problem of overcrowding. And pollution is a major concern.

NARRATOR: After 100 years of continuous pearl culturing in Ago Bay, the Akoya oyster is under assault.

NARRATOR: Katsumasa Tanaka and his wife, Kikumi, are second generation pearl farmers at Shimatown on Ago Bay. One of hundreds of independent producers in Japan, the Tanikas practice a technique handed down from Katsumasa's father, who started the family business more than 30 years ago.

KATSUMASA TANAKA: We are an average-sized farm for this area. We usually cultivate between 30,000 and 50,000 shells. But the mortality rate for our larger sized shells is very high. We are happy if even half of them survive. The reason for this are the condition of the sea and the natural factors like the weather.

NARRATOR: Ago Bay is no longer a quiet backwater. Today, it's a busy port surrounded by residential and tourist development. Industrial and domestic wastes are steadily polluting the once healthy waters in which the farmed oysters live and breathe.

FRED WARD: Oysters require clean water to produce good pearls. They're like the parakeet in the mine: They're a good barometer for what's going on. So, you need, as the farmer, to put that oyster basket into good water. And that's virtually unobtainable in an industrialized country like Japan.

NARRATOR: One threat is when toxin-producing plankton reproduce in great numbers, causing what is called "red tide." Long term problems with pollution have made Japanese scientists leading authorities on algal blooms. The senior manager at Mikimoto's Pearl Research Laboratory is Dr. Shigeru Akamatsu.

SHIGERU AKAMATSU: Red tides are usually caused by agricultural pesticides, detergents, or conditions which increase nutrients in the water. But with this type of red tide in Ago Bay, we unfortunately still don't know the cause.

NARRATOR: Every day, the laboratory collects samples to monitor the water quality in Ago Bay. When dangerously high levels of plankton are detected, Mikimoto scientists alert government authorities, who advise local farmers to reposition their oysters.

SHIGERU AKAMATSU: We experimented by forcing plankton into the oyster. Much to our surprise, when the plankton entered, the oyster tried very hard to expel the plankton. Within three to five minutes, the movement of its heart became very abnormal, and the oyster died at once. So, now we know this plankton is very dangerous.

NARRATOR: But red tide isn't the only problem. Ago Bay is now pushed to the limits, accommodating scores of small pearling companies.

KATSUMASA TANAKA: All the places you see here are pearl farms. Just in our area alone, there are over 130 companies. So, overcrowding, too, has become a huge problem.

NARRATOR: Packed tightly across the bay, the mesh of oyster nets restricts tidal movements, reducing the food supply. If the oysters don't grow, neither do the pearls. Rising mortality rates is one reason Japanese pearl farmers have taken to harvesting early.

NARRATOR: On some farms, the traditional three-year growth cycle has been reduced to as little as six months. Often, buyers are unwilling to risk the wait for higher-quality pearls. This harvest will supply the ready market for less expensive pearl jewelry.

KATSUMASA TANAKA: Several decades ago, in my father's time, almost all the pearls were a two-year crop, sometimes even three years. If we left these a year longer, they'd be of better quality. But to leave the oyster one more year is a costly gamble, because they'll probably die. And that's our dilemma.

NARRATOR: In the still-clean waters of Western Australia, pearl producers have been able to avoid many of the problems faced by Japanese farmers. But clean water alone is not enough. During the nucleation process, the large Australian oyster becomes stressed. An elaborate storage and conveyance system is designed to reduce the time it spends out of water.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: The Australian shell is a very difficult animal to deal with. It's a very delicate creature. It'll stress from being out of the water too long, it'll stress from being overcrowded with other oysters.

NARRATOR: No longer a secret, Mikimoto's technique is still performed here by Japanese technicians. A cut is made in the oyster, and a shell bead inserted into the flesh. Positioning the bead is critical. For a perfect round, the technicians aim for the reproductive organs.

It's traumatic for the oyster and demanding for the technicians, who perform up to 500 operations a day. One slip of the scalpel and the oyster could bleed to death.

NARRATOR: Nick Paspaley and his technicians have developed their own trade secrets. They've introduced antiseptics and hygienic conditions to minimize the oyster's exposure to infection.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: The results were spectacularly different. Mortality rates dropped to less than one percent, and the pearl shell is much happier.

NARRATOR: Unlike fish, oysters can survive out of water for hours.

But to minimize stress, they're stored in tanks immediately after nucleation, and then transported to huge underwater farms. Here, they're kept for three months to recover from the operation.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: What we try to do is help the shell to be perfect. The healthier a shell is, the more chance that it has of producing something without flaws or without problems in its growth cycle.

NARRATOR: Every two weeks, the oysters are cleaned to remove marine growths, which carry parasites and diseases that can affect the oyster's health, or even kill them. The cages are turned regularly, so that the embryonic pearls develop evenly. This way, they're more likely to produce the perfect spheres that are so highly prized in the marketplace.

NARRATOR: Once they've recovered, the oysters are transferred to one of the farms dotted in more sheltered waters. The farm at Talbot Bay is nestled among the ancient cliffs of the Kimberley Coast. It's home to more than 100,000 nucleated oysters. As the oysters mature, they're periodically x-rayed to gauge their progress. But with all the care in the world, nature still has the power to intervene. High winds and waves can kill unprotected oysters and tear apart entire farms.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: Several years ago, a big cyclone went through, and we had a whole fleet hiding from 250 kilometer winds. Every minute that you're out there in the middle of nature, it's sort of overpowering. You can't be there without feeling its presence.

NARRATOR: After two years of careful nurturing, the oysters are removed from the water, so that the pearls can be harvested. This is the moment of truth.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: At the end of the day, the shell is the one that does what it does and we really don't know what it's going to do, until two years later. Hence, it's quite exciting when you harvest. If you look at shells in the water and try to pick out which one of those shells has got the fine pearl, I think you've got more chance in a casino picking the roulette number.

NARRATOR: Now, in a second operation, the pearl is removed. After a two-year growth cycle, the hope for a result is a large pearl of excellent quality, with a thick coating of nacre. If an oyster yields a good-quality pearl, the technician immediately implants a fresh nucleus to start the process all over again. With a productive life of around eight years, an oyster can produce up to four pearls.

NARRATOR: As the oyster continues to grow, it can tolerate increasingly larger nuclei, so it will produce its biggest pearl towards the end of its life. Giant South Sea pearls such as this comprise only five percent of the world's pearl market. They are extravagantly expensive, and out of reach for most consumers. The smaller Japanese pearl is still the most popular and affordable. The Mikimoto Company specializes in the high-end of this vast consumer market.

SHIGERU AKAMATSU: This is a quality triangle. If we take this as an example, generally, the top quality items from the harvest comprise five percent of the total. Mikimoto concentrates on this top five percent to make its products.

NARRATOR: For years, the Mikimoto Company produced all the pearls it sold. Today, half of what it sells comes from other pearl suppliers. China and other Asian countries are rapidly developing their own pearl culturing industries, competing for the mass market with Japan's Akoya pearls. Japan's dominance has diminished as a producer, but Japanese companies still control much of the world's pearl market. The rest of it is shared by others. Nick Paspaley will soon be selling his most recent harvest.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: This is a fabulous crop. This is one of the nicer crops. And for this particular lot of shells, everything went right from day one, and nature was kind. And there's some fabulous pieces. But the ultimate objective is beauty. And beauty can only come from the maker itself.

NARRATOR: In the world of pearls, these command the highest price. And it is New York where many of them will end up. Americans spend more each year on pearl jewelry than any other consumers in the world. Much of what they buy passes through New York.

SAKVADOR ASSAEL: We are, I think, today, in the United States, great fashion leaders, because on Fifth Avenue, New York, you have Harry Winston, and then we have people like Van Cleef and Arpel, Tiffany, Cartier, Aspray. I mean, this type of jeweler, they are all-- Not only are they jewelers, but they create fashion. In other words, they have created the image for the pearl.

NARRATOR: One of this country's best known pearl dealers is Salvador Assael. He specializes in South Sea pearls from Tahiti and Australia, that command dazzling prices in New York's auction rooms and jewelry salons.

SALVADOR ASSAEL: Well, I love pearls beyond anything. I love my family most of all, I love my office staff most of all, but, after that, I love pearls most of all. There's a warmth to it that no other gem stone will do to me. A diamond I have no feeling for. To give you an idea here, here you have it right here, these are all Australian pearls. They are natural in the sense that-- They are not natural pearls, they're cultivated, of course, in the sense that the Australian pearl, just like the black pearl, too, but it's the only pearl, I would say, that comes out of the water and it is sold in its natural way. In other words, it is not bleached, it is not colored, it's just drilled, if you want to make a necklace or halved if you want to put it in an earring. This necklace, as you see it here, a woman will wear it for 20 years, 30 years, she can die and give it to her daughter, the daughter can wear it again for 20 or 30 or 40 years, and give it again. This necklace, this strand of pearls, can last hundreds of years.

KRISTIN JOYCE: What's interesting about pearls as fashion in the 20th century is probably the range of ages and the types of women who wear them, particularly in the '20s, with Josephine Baker, for example, who was an erotic Parisian dancer.

NARRATOR: Her flamboyant costumes included yards of the gem that had once been the trademark of nobility.

KRISTIN JOYCE: Josephine Baker wore nothing but pearls, encrusted bustiers and hula skirts with laces of pearls dangling down.

NEWSREEL: At the Folies-Bergère, the rage is Josephine Baker, daughter of a St. Louis washerwoman. Her loose-limbed abandon epitomizes Paris at night.

KRISTIN JOYCE: Twenty years later, we suddenly have the girl from the good family, we have the patrician upper-crust, particularly represented in the American cinema with women such as Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn, who were wearing gloves and hats and the perfect pearl choker.

STACEY OKUN: I think pearls have always been an extremely popular American phenomenon. There was a look in the 1950s that every woman in America emulated, every mother gave her daughter pearls on their graduation day, and these have been passed down, and we're into two more generations since then. I'm wearing my grandmother's pearls right now in my ears and on my blazer. It symbolized a wealth and a glamour that was very important in America. There are a handful of contemporary jewelry designers who are turning tradition on its ear with pearls, creating very modern, delicate looks with Biwa and South Sea pearls that you haven't seen before.

NARRATOR: These cross-shaped pearls are from Lake Biwa in Japan. Formed in fresh water mussels, the Biwa pearls are induced by inserting mantle tissue alone without a bead. As a result, it's the shape of the tissue that determines the shape of the pearl. But as environmental pollution contaminates the lake where they grow, these gems are now virtually unobtainable.

NARRATOR: Today, it is the black pearl that is capturing the attention of jewelry designers. Black pearls were once considered an exotic oddity, rare and almost mythical. Now, they are becoming increasingly popular.

NARRATOR: Salvador Assael claims credit for helping introduce the black pearl to New York's fashion jewelers. In the past few years, more islands in the South Pacific have been producing this once-rare commodity. Most black pearls are produced commercially in the remote coral atolls of Tahiti, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

NARRATOR: The warm ocean currents and concentration of plankton in these waters create a favorable environment for the black-lipped pearl oysters, pinctada margaratifara.. This oyster is second only to the giant pinctada maxima in size, growing up to 12 inches in width and weighing as much as 11 pounds. It can produce pearls ranging from 10 to 17 millimeters. The pearl's distinctive range of colors is determined by the dark shades of the oyster shell and may also be affected by mineral salts in the water.

SALVADOR ASSAEL: We feel there must be at least 40 different colors of black, ranging from peacock, which is the top color, down to the fine black, down to a gun metal gray, to almost very, very light gray.

NARRATOR: Like the Australians, Tahitian pearl producers have adapted the traditional Japanese methods of cultivation to suit local conditions. But typhoons and sudden temperature fluctuations make these oysters vulnerable. Until recently, mortality was high, with a third of oysters dying after nucleation.

NARRATOR: To ensure the future of pearl culturing, the industry must understand every aspect of the oyster's development, even manipulating its genes in the quest for ultimate control. Dr. John Lucas is experimenting with a method of artificially breeding oysters in hatcheries, so that the small island states of the South Pacific can develop their own pearling industries without plundering their reefs for wild oysters. The moment of spawning begins with a milky eruption.

JOHN LUCAS: Look it, clouds of sperm, millions of sperm in that lock there. And the typical sperm with little heads and long tails and they swim through the water. We're going to collect them. And we keep the males like this separate from the females, and the females release millions of eggs, and then we will fertilize the eggs with some of these sperm. The real advantage of hatcheries, however, is that you can select the oysters that have particular characteristics, and so you can start to have generations of oysters, perhaps you breed for oysters that have a bigger gap between the shell, so that you can put bigger beads in to make bigger pearls for the same size.

JOHN LUCAS: You can also select for oysters that have, say, a more silver luster, if that's what you want, or if they're black pearls, that have a more blacky green, the really desirable color. So, over a series of generations, you can achieve this. One of the really long-term futures could be to take the pearl oyster tissue and culture it in a test tube and then have that secrete nacre around beads, so that you have cultured pearls produced in a test tube.

NARRATOR: The Japanese were the first to experiment with artificial breeding techniques more than 50 years ago. Then, as now, there are not enough wild Akoya oysters to meet the demands of the industry. Today, they hatch oysters in large glass tanks inside laboratories. After two months' growth, the spats, or baby oysters, are suspended under water in breeding cages.

FRED WARD: Those oysters never bounce around on rocks and they never are rough and tumble in the surf and in the sand. And they just don't seem to ever grow as large or as healthy as natural oysters. The oysters that I saw in Ago Bay a few years ago were so weak and small that you could actually press on the side and they were flexible.

NARRATOR: Overbreeding from the same genetic strains may soften the oysters' shell. Because the shell is its only defense against the outside world, any weakness in this natural armor can put the health of the oyster at risk.

SHIGERU AKAMATSU: When the shell is so thin, it's easy for parasites to eat through it and enter the oyster's body. So, the oyster weakens and dies more easily. Scientists are now making a lot of effort to catch oysters in the wild. When we find them, we freeze their sperm. This way we hope to ensure the Akoya species survives. And the same technology can help to produce a stronger, healthier oyster for our industry. This is what we are striving for.

NARRATOR: But, even healthy oysters do not always produce perfect pearls.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: Five or ten percent is all you get in gem quality, five or ten percent of your crop may be gem quality if it's a good crop. And, of course, you also have fine quality, then you have good quality, and then you have the low quality. Actually, you need all of that to satisfy your markets. If it was all gem quality, you know, perhaps the scarcity factor might disappear.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: But, we don't have control over what the shell does with the pearl itself. It decides what color it's going to produce. It decides whether it's going to produce fine nacre or coarse nacre, if the rainbow colors are in the pearl or not. So, we have control over what we do. But, nature and the shells, they control the rest. And we just hope-- we hope it all works for us.

NARRATOR: At the end of the annual harvest, every gem is graded by shape, color, lustre and size. The painstaking process of matching the pearls then begins.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: To get the size, the shape and the exact color match, it's almost impossible. This strand-- This is the third year I've had this strand. And I'm confident we'll complete it from this year's crop. But, what we do is we have a first selection in the first year, and try to make it as perfect as we can in that year. But, then if it's not completed because we just don't have the pieces that match, then we'll keep it over for the next year. And from that crop we'll go right through all the crop. This will sell probably for about $350,000 U.S. dollars when it's completed.

NARRATOR: With only 150 gem quality South Sea necklaces produced in a year, these cultured pearls have started to command prices at auction once reserved for rare natural pearls.

NARRATOR: In 1992, an Australian South Sea necklace was sold at Sotheby's in New York for $2.3 million dollars, a world auction record.

Pearls have once more become icons of wealth and power.

SOTHEBY'S: This is the premier South Sea's necklace which we're offering in this magnificent jewelry sale. The pearls range from close to 15 millimeters to over 17 millimeters. As you can see it's a perfect match. Wonderful color and lustre.

One of the pearls is also incredibly rare, and they become rarer in these large fine qualities because of environmental problems. So, the unpredictability of nature effects the value of these pearls as well.

AUCTIONEER: Any advance over $800,000? L268.

NARRATOR: Australia's cultured pearl industry continues to benefit from the luxury of largely unpolluted waters. Off the country's remote northern coast, pearl farmers can still collect wild shells, but only with a permit. Strictly enforced quotas limit the number of shells each farmer can collect, helping to ensure the future of Australia's wild oyster population.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: You're talking to a man who has done well out of this beautiful natural resource. Over the years I've been involved with hatcheries, with people's ideas of cultivating pearls in great big factories in Japan with controlled environments and all that sort of-- all those ideas.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: It's the arrogance of man that makes him think well, I can create this in a factory. Well, I doubt it, you know. The only reason we have success with these is because we've got nature creating this for us. We couldn't do this if we tried. In fact, the only problems that we ever have in our industry are the problems that we've created.

FRED WARD: It makes you realize how vulnerable it all is once you start looking at the problem areas. So, you see there are more and more people on earth. They're polluting the earth more and more. Humans do have a certain amount of waste associated with their lives. And this is bad for pearling.

A good oil tanker wreck off the coast of any pearling country would probably wipe out production for some years.

__: Are you still set on my bringing you a pearl from the depths of the Indian Ocean?

__: Yes, a big pearl, a really big pearl.

NARRATOR: Pearls were once considered miraculous, a gift from the Gods. Science may have unraveled the oyster's secrets, but the pearl remains an evocative symbol of nature's genius, and a haunting reminder that humans too often destroy what they treasure most.

NICHOLAS PASPALEY: There's something unique about pearls that you don't see in anything else. And they have that mysterious characteristic which is very hard to describe. It's like the moon, you know. It's almost like these don't come from our life.

NARRATOR: In an obscure museum in eastern Europe, a fossil hunter has made a startling discovery. While randomly sifting through a set of drawers he found a collection that hadn't been examined for 30 years.

PER AHLBERG (Natural History Museum, London): I was going through these drawers, finding drawer after drawer of very much the sort of fossil I would expect to find, really nothing of any particular excitement. And then, pulling open one drawer, I spotted in the middle, sitting in a little cardboard tray like so, a fossil the likes of which had...never have been found anywhere in the world.

NARRATOR: The paleontologist, Per Ahlberg, had found a new piece of evidence in a 400 million-year-old detective story: how and why creatures first left the water to live on land.

NEIL SHUBIN (University of Chicago): For a long time, all life was in water—in the seas, in the ocean. And it's not until about 370 million years ago that we start to find the first animals venturing out on land. Fins evolved into limbs at some point in that time period.

NARRATOR: For over a century scientists have searched the world for fossils that can help them unravel the mystery. Now a series of new discoveries is shaking up long-held views on how evolution fashioned this profound transformation, how it happened that fish left the water for land and became the ancestors of us all.

NARRATOR: In north-central Pennsylvania, near the Appalachian towns of Hyner and Renovo, stretches an ancient sandstone formation known as Red Hill. It was here that paleontologists Neil Shubin and Ted Daeschler discovered extraordinary new clues in one of evolution's most enduring mysteries: how ancient creatures left the water to walk on land.

NEIL SHUBIN:	The reason why I am in this business is because of a sense of discovery. I mean that's really what I like to do. Being a paleontologist is great because if you look at rocks of the right age, of the right type, and if you're really lucky, sometimes you can find a fossil which will fill one of these big gaps in evolution, one of these big transformations.

TED DAESCHLER (Academy of Natural Sciences): It's a detective story and you're finding evidence out there. We're breaking rocks and we're looking for little pieces of evidence to help piece together this, this story of how limbs developed from fins.

NARRATOR: The story began to take shape back in the 18th century with a simple but crucial observation, a vast array of animals showed striking similarities. They all had four limbs. They are tetrapods.

PER AHLBERG:	We are tetrapods—to wit: one, two, three, four. Horses are tetrapods evidently enough.

NARRATOR: So are dogs. So are lions, tigers and bears.

PER AHLBERG:	So is a bird: two hind legs, two wings at the front which are modified front legs.

A snake is a tetrapod. It has no legs any more, but it's quite clear that they derived from a lizard ancestry which had both fore limbs and hind limbs.

NARRATOR: Non-tetrapods have a wide variety of body plans. Some have hundreds of legs. Some have none. But all tetrapods, beneath the skin, share similar features.

They all have backbones with special interlocking spurs. It's as true of us as it was of the dinosaurs. All tetrapods have a pelvis attached to the backbone to support their weight. They all have a ribcage to protect the heart and lungs. And they all breath air through nostrils. Their limbs invariably consist of a single bone nearest the body, the humerus, then a pair of bones, the radius and ulna, leading to feet or hands—which never seemed to have more than five fingers or toes.

It's true of dinosaurs, human beings, and even whales—for under their flippers, whales have five fingers.

NEIL SHUBIN:	If mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians all have this common structure, what does that mean? That means they all must have descended from an ancestor that already had this structure.

Our question is, "What did that ancestor look like? Where did it come from?"

NARRATOR: Sometime during the four-billion-year history of life on Earth there were primitive tetrapods from which all four-limbed, air-breathing creatures descended—amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals.

And even further back in time, there were water-dwelling creatures, fish, that were the ancestors of those first tetrapods.

The fish likely belonged to a group known as lobe-fins. Like this modern-day lungfish, the ancient lobe-fins had lungs as well as gills and a unique structure in their fins that looked like a precursor to arms and legs.

NEIL SHUBIN:	There are two types of bony fish on the Earth today, ray-fin fish and lobe-fin fish. Now, ray-fin fish are very common, as represented by this common sole here. This creature's dinner. And, in fact, most of what we have for dinner are the ray-fin fish.

The reason why we call them ray-fin fish is because their fins are composed of a very special sort of bone. You can see them here. These are the rods. These are the rays that make up most of the surface area of the fin. The type of bone that makes up these rays is not present in our limbs. Now, this monster here, for better or for worse, is one of the fish that's most closely related to us. It's a lobe-fin fish. And the reason why we call it a lobe-fin fish is because its fin is composed mostly of this thing here, which you can see is this fleshy lobe. Now, from an evolutionary perspective this lobe is very important because many of the bones that make up our limbs actually first evolved within this lobe.

NARRATOR: Lobe-fin fishes were common during a time in Earth's history called the Devonian Period, a hundred-fifty million years before the age of dinosaurs began. Tetrapod's fossils were plentiful in rock layers younger than the Devonian, but older rock layers yielded no tetrapods at all—only more primitive creatures like sponges, worms and some fish.

So the water-to-land transition must have occurred during the Devonian Period, between about 410 and 360 million years ago.

PER AHLBERG:	Imagine for a moment that you were able to go back to the world just before the beginning of the move onto land. Let's say you go back to the world of 500 million years ago, and you stand on the shore. What do you find?

Well, let's say it's low tide. So you walk down onto the tidal flats. You find it's really not that different from today. There are rock pools, and maybe anemones and stuff growing in them. There are seaweeds draped over the rocks. There are little arthropod things, crustacean-like creatures and so on scuttling around. The overall picture, the system is there. And it's not so different from today.

But turn your back to the sea and walk inland and what do you find? A barren, empty wasteland: no greenery, no trees, no insects. Wind keening over the rocks. A barren land that could not possibly support you.

Then, in a time frame between about 450 and 350 million years ago, group after group of organisms start making their way onto land, assembling the immensely complex land ecosystem which we inhabit today.

NARRATOR: In 1881, on the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec, a crucial discovery was made by a Canadian farmer. He stumbled upon the most perfect fossils of lobe-fin fishes ever seen, in rock from the Devonian period. Called Eusthenopteron, the layout of its fin bones showed a striking resemblance to the bone structure of tetrapod limbs, and with a clarity never before seen.

KEITH THOMSON (Oxford University): Here in these fossils the limb was just laid out simply beautifully, and it was so easy to turn it in your mind into a tetrapod limb. These bones, the one and the two bones, they were, they were laid out, and there were these bits in the, the, the ankle and the, the wrist and so on—absolutely fantastic, beautiful material. Clinched it really.

NARRATOR: What they thought they'd clinched was the sort of fish from which we all came, an ancestor with fins that were verging on limbs. But could they find creatures that looked more like tetrapods—animals with the beginnings of true arms and legs?

Despite years of searching, fossil hunters had never found tetrapods in Devonian rock layers. Perhaps, there were none. Or perhaps none had ever become fossilized.

KEITH THOMSON: The chances of any animal becoming a fossil are extraordinarily remote. And the only way that we have a lot of fossils is that there's been an incredible amount of time and an unbelievable number of animals.

The animal originally had some hard part that was preserved even though the soft parts were dissolved away by bacterial action. Then it got buried in a place where bacterial action stopped, usually in mud or something like that. And then it has to be covered up pretty soon with some kind of a sediment of sandstone, silt or maybe volcanic ash. And then it will gradually get further and further into the Earth. And then the next thing is, because a fossil is something that's dug up, it has to be...come near the surface and somebody has to find it.

NARRATOR: In 1931, fossil hunters got lucky. A team of Swedish scientists on a geological expedition to Greenland came upon a 360 million-year-old Devonian creature that definitely was not a fish. It had the telltale bone structure of a tetrapod. It appeared to be a milestone along the evolutionary path from living in water to living on land.

They named it Ichthyostega, meaning "fish-plate," since the roof of its skull was still fish-like.

KEITH THOMSON: People had been looking for this, in a way, ever since Darwin, ever since 1859. This transition is the one that so intrigued everybody—going from the water to the land—and no evidence of it. And then, boom, they found it. Terribly, terribly exciting really. Very, very important.

NARRATOR: It fell to Erik Jarvik to analyze this crucial new discovery. He spent years digging hundreds of fossilized bones out of the rock to try to reconstruct the anatomy of the creature. Jarvik was a brilliant anatomist, incredibly painstaking. He began working on Ichthyostega in 1948, but didn't complete the work until two years before his death in 1998. And during Jarvik's nearly 50 years of research no one else was able to study the fossil.

PER AHLBERG:	If a particular research group has collected material and is actively engaged in studying that material, then other people don't muscle in and take it away.

KEITH THOMSON: It was extremely frustrating to everybody that they were holding this to their chest as it were, and only letting out little bits of information while everybody else was going crazy trying to write and work in a field in which you know somebody else has a lot of information and you don't know what it is.

NARRATOR: Jarvik did release two papers during the course of his research comparing Ichthyostega to the fish Eusthenopteron. He was convinced that Ichthyostega had been a true tetrapod with a ribcage, a pelvis attached to a backbone with interlocking spurs, and four limbs with five digits each that would have enabled the creature to walk on land.

Ichthyostega was then the most primitive tetrapod ever found. Still, there must have been several intermediate creatures between it and a fish like Eusthenopteron.

KEITH THOMSON: No one was ever really satisfied with Eusthenopteron as the immediate ancestor of something like Ichthyostega. So I think people have been, not only been looking for things that are a little less fish-like than Eusthenopteron, they've also been looking for things that are a little more fish-like from Ichthyostega. So wanted to close the gap from both sides.

NARRATOR: Somewhere in the rocks there may be other fossils of four-legged creatures from the Devonian Period that would help fill in the evolutionary sequence from water to land. There may be more what are often called "missing links." Charles Darwin called them "transitional forms" in his 1859 masterwork on evolution.

One striking transitional fossil was found in 1861, the archaeopteryx, a reptile with feathers. It was widely hailed as proof that birds had dinosaur ancestors. But few such clearly transitional forms have been discovered.

PER AHLBERG:	Presumably the transitional forms are very rapidly out-competed by their more...by their own more advanced descendants. So these transitional episodes in the history of life tend to be brief and involve, it seems, relatively low numbers of species and probably low numbers of individuals.

NARRATOR: Some transitions occur when there are dramatic environmental changes. Creatures not well suited to the new environment die out. But, just by chance, some members of a population will be able to survive: those with thicker fur if a climate turns colder; those with longer bills if a major food source develops deeper flowers.

STEPHEN JAY GOULD (Harvard University): Most of evolution is stability and the production of new species that are pretty like the ones that came before. We have 500,000 species of beetles just for starters. But every once in a while you do have a transition to a very different kind of environment. Or you do have the invention evolutionarily of a very different kind of organ or structure that allows the occupation of a part of the ecological world that wasn't inhabited before. And that catches our attention. So there was a point when you didn't have organisms on land, so what was it about the evolution of creatures that lived in the sea that allowed them to get onto land?

NARRATOR: The most popular explanation for why fish evolved to walk on land was proposed by Harvard paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer. Romer based his hypothesis, known as the "drying pond scenario," on a view long held by geologists that the red color of Devonian rock meant it had been a time of severe drought.

PER AHLBERG:	The drying pond scenario basically ran like this: there were lobe-fin fishes living in the rivers and lakes of the Devonian continents, but because of the seasonal droughts that were supposed to be happening, during the dry season a lot of these pools would be drying out. And fishes stuck in a drying pond would be faced with the choice either of just sitting it out glumly in the mud and hoping for rain, or else boldly setting out overland in search of another and perhaps more permanent water body.

The idea was that lobe-fin fishes became gradually better and better at using their lobe fins to drag themselves across the mud.

NARRATOR: Romer suggested that limbs evolved as fish adapted to making this desperate march across land. These would have become the first tetrapods, our ancestors.

Throughout the early 20th century a mere handful of fossils shaped our view of Devonian creatures. Then, quite remarkably, from the waters off South Africa's east coast, the Devonian Period suddenly came alive. Just before Christmas 1938, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, the curator of a small museum in East London, South Africa, was called down to the docks to examine a most unusual catch.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER (East London Museum, South Africa): Twenty-second December 1938 was a wonderful day. I came onto this most beautiful fish. It was just on...just on 5 foot. It was silver and gold and green and blue and had white, kind of, flecks on it. And to my horror it had these limb-like fins. And I thought to myself, "What on earth can this be? I've never seen a fish like this."

Somehow I was going to preserve it. Somehow, whatever happened, I had to save it. That was this intuition that I had: "It must be saved at all costs."

NARRATOR: Unable to have the fish frozen, she left it with a taxidermist until Dr. J.L.B. Smith, a prominent South African scientist, could come identify it.

MARJORIE COURTENAY-LATIMER: He stood at the head of the table, and he said, "Well, lass," he said, "this fish will be on the lips of every scientist in the world. It's a coelacanth."

NARRATOR: Coelacanths are a group of lobe-finned fishes that lived during the Devonian Period and were thought to have gone extinct over 76 million years ago.

KEITH THOMSON: It was absolutely fantastic because it was...it's living and it, it's exactly like having found a live dinosaur or a live archaeopteryx. And it was all those things like The Lost World by Arthur Conan-Doyle and whatnot come true. It was absolutely amazing.

ARCHIVE FILM NARRATION: Meet Professor Smith of Grahamstown, South Africa with a model of that famous fish, the coelacanth.

J.L.B. SMITH (on tape): Coelacanths are close relatives of the fish that scientists consider was the ancestor of all land animals. The coelacanths have lived for probably 350 million years, and in that time they have changed but little. As you see, the fins are more like paddles than ordinary fins.

NARRATOR: Smith was convinced the Coelacanth could actually move about on the ocean floor using its lobed fins.

J.L.B. SMITH (on tape): I have no doubt that this fish crawls about on the bottom quite easily.

ARCHIVE FILM NARRATOR: Yes, the Professor says the fish is a kind of ancestor of man. Poor fish.

KEITH THOMSON: It was found in December so that means it was the middle of the summer. Huge fish, five feet or so. No way to preserve it, so it was preserved in a taxidermist mount, a skin mount, with the bones of the head and the skin. And everything else was thrown away which of course was a tragedy because all sorts of information went with it.

NARRATOR: With little left to study, Smith was determined to find another coelacanth, alive, and offered a reward to local fishermen.

It took 13 years, but finally a coelacanth was found off the Comoros Islands near Madagascar. It didn't walk on the bottom, but it was later seen that its fins moved in an alternating left-right pattern, just like tetrapods do when walking.

After studying the complete creature, Smith realized that coelacanth had less in common with tetrapods than he had thought. Most of its organs were distinctly fish-like. Coelacanths must have survived virtually unchanged since branching off from an ancestral fish some 360 million years ago.

But Eusthenopteron, also a fish with limb-like fins, was on a different evolutionary branch, one that produced four-legged creatures like Ichthyostega.

The next question was, "What animals filled the 20-million-year gap between Eusthenopteron, the fish, and Ichthyostega, the tetrapod?

The answer came in 1981, from a motorcycle enthusiast who was also Per Ahlberg's advisor at Cambridge University Museum.

PER AHLBERG:	I would be sitting there working in the morning, and if I'd got in early I'd suddenly hear this sound from the courtyard, which was the Associate Director of Vertebrates arriving for her daily work at the museum.

JENNY CLACK (Cambridge University): I was always somebody who was interested in natural history, really from as far back as I can remember. And in England we have little I Spy books, where you tick off what you seen. And I used to have a whole collection of those, and a whole collection of the little Observer's books. We used to go on holiday specifically so that I could either look at the local fall flora and fauna, or look for fossils.

NARRATOR: Jenny Clack had long dreamed of solving the mystery of how and why creatures first walked on land, but it seemed a remote possibility.

JENNY CLACK:	I had just finished my thesis when I started work here and was looking around for another project and a colleague of mine said, "Don't worry, something will turn up." And I didn't believe him.

NARRATOR: What turned up was the notebook of a geology student who had visited Greenland years earlier. In one corner he'd made an extraordinary note: he'd found remains of Ichthyostega, the creature Erik Jarvik had discovered.

JENNY CLACK:	He'd noted, "Ichthyostega bones and skull bones common." And early tetrapod specimens are not common anywhere, particularly not Devonian tetrapods on a mountain in Greenland.

Even when they'd been collected in the thirties they weren't common. They were chance finds after days of walking the scree. And to see this in his notebook just set the bells ringing: "We have to go there."

NARRATOR: It took six years to raise the funds for the expedition, but finally Jenny Clack headed off. Accompanying her was her Ph.D. student, Per Ahlberg.

PER AHLBERG:	We were very excited to be going at last, but this was of course also coupled with a certain trepidation. This was a big undertaking. It was an expensive expedition involving air support, helicopter time, all sorts of things.

JENNY CLACK:	It's at least 100 miles from the nearest permanent habitation, and that's an airstrip which is only manned during summer.

PER AHLBERG:	And of course it was possible that we were going to find almost nothing, or at least nothing new. So the potential was there on the one hand for a spectacular success and on the other hand for a considerable embarrassment.

JENNY CLACK:	The landscape is vast. You have no sense of scale, because there are no trees. And so something will look as though it will take you half an hour to reach—it actually takes you several hours.

NARRATOR: Even with maps and detailed notes Ahlberg and Clack feared they'd never find the right spot.

JENNY CLACK:	The notes in the books say 825 meters. And, in fact, that was wrong. We'd been starting too high up the mountain. And eventually we thought, well, first of all we thought, "Are we on the right mountain?" And then we checked. And yes, it was the right mountain. So we decided that we would start from lower down.

NARRATOR: When they explored the mountain at a lower elevation, Clack saw something.

JENNY CLACK:	It was covered with dirt and soil. It very nearly got thrown on the scrap heap, but, fortunately, we brushed some of the dirt off and we could see part of a skull.

NARRATOR: They had found the most complete tetrapod specimens since Erik Jarvik's expedition 56 years earlier: fossils of a four-legged Devonian creature called Acanthostega.

Clack returned to Cambridge with dozens of fossils. At last, someone other than Jarvik would be able to do original work.

But the true importance of the trip did not emerge until Acanthostega had undergone several years of painstaking preparations. Clack recalls it was her colleague, Mike Coates, who first saw a hand emerge from the rock.

JENNY CLACK:	The first thing he found on this block was a finger. This digit here. So we've got a number of finger bones aligned along the edge of this block. Then he continued with the preparation and he found the next finger which is here with its end curled over and then a third, similarly with this crooked finger end and a fourth, again with that. And then there's a gap. And then he went on to find another finger. Individual finger bones are really quite clear. And that makes a total of five. But he still had all this area here to prepare, so instead of stopping he went on to clean up the rest of this area. And lo and behold here is another digit. So that makes six, and he expected to finish there. And then, to his amazement, here's a seventh and finally an eighth. What?

PER AHLBERG:	My initial thought, before I had seen the specimen, was that there might be a problem here. If the specimen is preserved in such a way that the two fore-limbs are lying on top of each other it's easy to see how you could produce something that would look like a hand with more than five digits. And I wondered whether something like that was going on—whether there was in fact an interpretation problem. But of course once I'd seen the specimen it was perfectly plain that that was not so, that you did indeed have a fore-limb with a humerus, radius, ulna, and eight little fingers in a row.

NARRATOR: Acanthostega had eight fingers on one hand, suddenly calling into question one of the most basic assumptions behind the previous hundred years of research.

PER AHLBERG:	Until that day I had assumed, like everyone else, that five was the primitive number of digits for a tetrapod limb. The old explanations for the origin of the structure, after all one of the most fundamental and defining structures of being a tetrapod, and, in our own way, of being human, was in the bin.

NARRATOR: Ahlberg and Clack now believe our earliest ancestors with legs must have had numerous digits, and then somehow evolution reduced them to five over the eons.

And upon further examination, Acanthostega called another fundamental assumption into question. Its limbs were not made for walking.

JENNY CLACK:	If you look at the limbs, what you find is that the joints are all orientated, angled, so that the limb would have stretched out just to the sides. On the end of the humerus, the radius and ulna just fit in grooves along the end of the bone, not, as they would in a later animal, underneath there. So it's not supporting weight like this. There's just no way that it could have brought its leg underneath to take any weight.

Similarly with the hind limb, which we found a bit later on—similar kind of arrangement, no ankle to speak of, just a paddle-like limb.

NARRATOR: Acanthostega's legs would have been useless for walking. And what's more, it could never have lived out of the water for long. It breathed primarily with gills, like a fish. The evolution of legs was apparently not triggered by the need to walk on land.

JENNY CLACK:	So the thing that has really changed is that rather than the fish going onto the land while it's, it's still got fins, we've turned that completely on its head, so now we've got tetrapods in the water, still in the water, while they've got limbs with digits.

NARRATOR: Stunned by these revelations, Clack checked her findings against a fragment of Ichthyostega which she'd found in Greenland. Her team prepared the specimen and counted the toes.

JENNY CLACK:	Seven. Why didn't Jarvik see this?

NARRATOR: There was more that Jarvik had not seen. Clack found that Ichthyostega's legs were also not made for walking. They, too, were more like paddles.

Ichthyostega lived around the same time as Acanthostega, 360 million years ago. And while they both had limbs and gills, Acanthostega was a bit more fish-like, especially in the structure of its tail. These differences show how evolution was experimenting, tinkering with different body plans that would eventually result in all modern four-limbed animals.

But what drove these changes?

It had been widely accepted that fish evolved legs to move between bodies of water during times of drought, the drying pond scenario. But now that explanation no longer fit the facts.

The next piece of the puzzle was unearthed in the United States. During the Devonian Period, North America was part of a huge landmass called Laurasia, made up of present-day Europe, Asia and Greenland. Lying near the equator, Laurasia had great tropical sandstone formations, which became home to fossils of myriad life forms. And when the continents drifted to their present positions, over the next 400 million years, these fossils were scattered across the globe.

Here in Pennsylvania, a wide stretch of Devonian sandstone runs through the hills. Most of the range is forested, the ancient sandstone layers, buried. But there are places where the Devonian layer was exposed when the hills were blasted away to build new highways.

Paleontologist Ted Daeschler began combing this area, known as Red Hill, while a graduate student of Neil Shubin. No one had found tetrapod fossils here despite years of searching, and Daeschler was hoping for a change of luck in a newly excavated road-cut.

TED DAESCHLER: Well, sometimes you'll open up a rock and it really changes the whole way that you may be thinking about a certain problem, about something in evolution that you've learned. But you might change what the next student will learn. In fact, science works by building on the ideas of others.

NARRATOR: In 1995 Daeschler opened up a Red Hill rock and discovered a nearly perfect bone. It was the first piece of a Devonian tetrapod ever found on the North American continent.

TED DAESCHLER: We named it Hynerpeton, which means crawling animal from Hyner. And actually the town down below us here is Hyner, Pennsylvania. And the first part of the body that we found, actually the original material and all we had to work with for a while, was its shoulder girdle. And a shoulder girdle actually is a very interesting part to find if you're looking at some of the earliest limbed animals because it shows you where that limb attached into the body. And we could tell from the shoulder girdle of Hynerpeton that it was an animal with very muscular limbs. It's not like the shoulder girdle of a fish at all.

NARRATOR: More able to carry its own weight than either Acanthostega or Ichthyostega, Hynerpeton could possibly have walked on land.

Daeschler and his colleagues had noticed something else. Among the swathes of red sandstone were patches of green material.

TED DAESCHLER: Okay, the majority of the rock out here at Red Hill, of course, is red. Climbing up through sandstones, siltier sandstones and mudstones, right into this zone. Up here, we start with a green layer. It's reduced probably because of all of the plant material that's buried within the rock here.

NARRATOR: Finding these fossilized plants prompted the Red Hill team to rethink some old ideas. Perhaps the late Devonian environment wasn't as drought-ridden as experts had thought for nearly a century. Perhaps it was more like a rainforest.

TED DAESCHLER: The most common thing we're finding is a tree-like plant. It actually has a long, tall trunk and some people say these got up to 30 meters tall. So these were truly the first canopy, sort of, producing plants. We also find fern-like plants and a variety of other things. And so we're really seeing a diversity from a site like Red Hill.

Well, these stream systems that were running across big, wide floodplains 370 million years ago would have created big, muddy channels. And in between those channels there would have been forests, in fact, these were some of the first forests on Earth. Plants had finally taken hold of land environments, and that's a very important change when you think about it. The Earth was brown and muddy for the billions of years previous to this point in time. And it was during the late Devonian, really, that the land got green...and especially in wet areas like these deltas, that were shedding off and running into a seaway out in Ohio.

So what was happening on land was new, and what was happening with the animals in the fresh water environments was also new.

NARRATOR: The Earth may once have been barren, but the findings in Pennsylvania suggest that by the end of the Devonian, the Earth was densely forested and etched with rivers. These were bordered by something completely new, swamp. The first four-limbed creatures may have evolved in this wholly new ecosystem, just the kind of environmental shift that can trigger major evolutionary change.

KEITH THOMSON: For the very first time in Earth history animals and plants are living on land in a significant, permanent way. And a lot of open niches in that waiting to be exploited.

NARRATOR: Some of these new niches were the margins of this watery world. In the tangle of vegetation creatures with limbs and fingers would have a real advantage over those with fins.

TED DAESCHLER:	I think we have to think of these fins or, or limbs, or "flims" as something that would be used by the animal for moving through more complex environments like swamps, or environments that...where there may have been trees down in channels, or just shallow water, to pursue prey or to escape the guy who's trying to prey upon you.

NARRATOR: And there was definitely something to escape from. The Red Hill team found evidence of a predator of terrifying proportions. A fish Keith Thomson had named Hyneria.

TED DAESCHLER:	Hyneria is the most common lobe-finned fish at this site. It's also the biggest. It's probably two or three meters long. This, this is a single tooth from a large hyneria, and these were carnivorous, obviously.

KEITH THOMSON: And with a few predators like that around swimming in the channels of an estuary of a mud flat delta system, you could see why some of the lobe-fin fishes might find it very judicious to hop out into the growth...into the undergrowth, and find somewhere else to live.

NARRATOR: The revised picture of the Devonian environment opened up new ways of thinking about the forces that drove the evolution from fish to tetrapods. Limbs seem to have evolved not after a fish ventured onto land, but before. They were useful to navigate through swamps, to avoid predators, or, perhaps, to lay eggs on shore, out of harm's way. Limbs and fingers evolved because they gave the creatures who had them a distinct advantage in the swampy Devonian world. Using them to walk on dry land was a happy accident.

NEIL SHUBIN:	What the tetrapod story shows us is that evolution is not goal-directed. It wasn't trying to evolve limbs. What is evolution in this case? It's just tinkering. What we're seeing is in these streams, 370 million years ago, a bunch of different types of fish tinkering with new ways of making a living, living in that new environment. It just so happened, one of those tinkered solutions was extremely successful. It led to all later life that was to live on land.

NARRATOR: More of nature's tinkering would be revealed when Per Ahlberg, now of London's Natural History Museum, visited eastern Europe. He began rummaging around in a forgotten drawer of an obscure fossil collection at a museum in Latvia, and a piece of bone caught his eye. It turned out to be a jaw fragment from a Devonian creature that showed both fish and tetrapod characteristics.

PER AHLBERG:	I picked this piece up, had a look at it, turned it around, and, really, I knew within about half a minute that here was something absolutely extraordinary.

NARRATOR: Ahlberg named the creature Livoniana, after the region in Latvia where it was found. And to confirm his suspicions that it really was a transitional fossil, he ran it through something called a "cladistic analysis." It's a database that lists all the anatomical features that distinguish fish from tetrapods.

Some are obvious: does the specimen have limbs or fins? Lungs, gills or both? Others reflect minute shifts in the position of blood vessels or bones. Such fine detail allows scientists to identify a creature from just a fossil fragment and place it on an evolutionary tree relative to other animals.

As an example of the kinds of distinctions cladistic analysis can make, Ahlberg has placed a lobe-finned fish jaw on one side, the Livoniana jaw in the middle, and a tetrapod jaw on the other side. The differences are subtle, but significant.

PER AHLBERG:	What you can see if we look at the endpoints is that these two jaws differ in quite a lot of ways. First of all, if we look at this pit in the fish jaw which is particularly important feature, a deep hollow that goes all the way through to underlying bones, the bone you get in the bottom there is a different one to the ones that are coming up on the surface here. In Livoniana that's the same place. The pit has almost disappeared surrounding now a blood vessel hole here, which we didn't have in the other jaw. If we look at the tetrapod, we have the pit now gone altogether. And here's that lower blood vessel hole there in the tetrapod. So, in this respect, Livoniana kind of agrees with the tetrapod. On the other hand, we find that in the fish a bone from the outer surface of the jaw comes round down to here and ends, and it's, it abuts against another bone up here called the pre-articula.

In the tetrapod the bone from the outer face comes all the way up here. It forms a big tongue extending backwards, so, and it comes all the way up here beneath it. So quite a different arrangement.

Livoniana here has got the junction and the bone exposed on the surface just like the fish, so in this case Livoniana agrees with the fish. So as you can see, depending on which characteristic you look at, it either lies sort of halfway between or it agrees with the tetrapod or it agrees with the fish—exactly what you would expect from an intermediate form.

NARRATOR: The analysis shows Livoniana to be clearly a transitional creature. It fits on an evolutionary tree about midway between fish and tetrapods.

And it has one very odd feature: there are seven rows of teeth. That makes it unlike any other creature we know of and suggests that it may have been one of a host of evolutionary experiments, most of which met with extinction, but one of which was the ancestor of us all.

In recent years, Darwin's 400 million-year-old detective story has become much less shrouded in mystery. In the Devonian world of forest and rivers bordered by swamp, a whole new way of life was born. The distinction between being in the water and out of it became blurred. From this swampy place, our ancestor came crawling onto dry land. It was one of the most momentous events in all of evolution, for one day that creature's descendants would inherit the Earth.
<|endoftext|>

NARRATOR: Something strange is happening in the forests of Africa. Chimpanzees are doing things no one has seen them do before: they are having pool parties. But that's not all. At a site called Fongoli, in Senegal, they have also invented a remarkable way to catch a meal. They are making spears and hunting, just like our ancestors.

Fresh steaks and a swimming pool? How long until they fire up the barbecue? After all, the great apes—chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas, and bonobos—seem so much like us, it's hard not to feel a deep connection.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology): We have come to see that we're much more similar to them than we ever imagined.

NARRATOR: But for every revelation about the power of their minds, another shows up a stunning difference.

REBECCA SAXE (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): If you think that human genetics and ape genetics are 99 percent the same, what we've managed to achieve in our current position on Earth is so strikingly different from that of apes.

BRIAN HARE (Duke University): We're trying to figure out, "What is it that makes us human? What's the little difference that makes the big difference?"

NARRATOR: How big is the gap between them and us? What's holding them back? Inside ape minds, right now on this NOVA/National Geographic special.

Major funding for NOVA is provided by David H. Koch. And...

NARRATOR: In a remote part of Africa, there's something new under the sun. Our closest living relatives are getting bold. Chimps are supposed to be afraid of water, but this young male is climbing down for a dip. He keeps a hand on a natural safety line as he overcomes his fear. Has a boy or girl ever had more fun in a swimming hole? Wild chimps have never before been seen playing like this.

At Fongoli, Senegal, anthropologist Jill Pruetz and psychologist Andrew Whiten are getting an extraordinary glimpse of chimp emotions.

ANDREW WHITEN (University of St. Andrews): The personality of a chimpanzee is extremely excitable. I've hardly ever seen a facial expression like that. I mean, that was extreme excitement to the stage of kind of losing control.

JILL PRUETZ (Iowa State University): It's not merely just to cool off. The juveniles have fun. I mean, they play in the water. They play a lot in the water.

NARRATOR: This is only one of a rush of discoveries that is painting a surprising new portrait of ape minds. They are more like us than most researchers ever imagined.

One by one, the skills and emotions we once thought were uniquely human are being found in apes. Still, certain specific mental gaps—the little differences that make the big difference—will ultimately explain why we study them and not the other way around.

While the swimming hole is revealing chimps' emotions in the field, a new laboratory study is showing off their amazing rational powers.

At the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, psychologist Josep Call places a peanut in a clear tube.

How can the chimpanzee get the snack? She has never seen this puzzle before.

JOSEP CALL (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology): For 10 minutes, there is no solution in sight. And all of a sudden, boom, they solve it. They have to understand that they can use the water as a tool. This is interesting, because the water itself, it doesn't have any shape.

NARRATOR: Using water as a tool seems like something we would do—on a good day.

Another tool is being put to remarkable use by wild chimps in their quest for a meal. Back in Senegal, Jill Pruetz has been keeping a close eye on chimps' eating habits. Throughout Africa, chimps eat almost anything, and they have a particular taste for meat. Here, their favorite prey is the bush baby, a small nocturnal primate.

But these chimps aren't catching bush babies barehanded. Pruetz has seen chimps making spears and using them to hunt.

Andrew Whiten hopes to join the ranks of the few who have witnessed this extraordinary behavior.

Pruetz has just collected a spear jammed in the top of a dead tree.

JILL PRUETZ: So I'd say, I guess, this one is longer than average.

ANDREW WHITEN: Yeah, this is a big, long and fairly stout one.

JILL PRUETZ: Yeah, yeah.

ANDREW WHITEN: But the length of it's interesting, because that's a big hole. And this thing's pretty well judged to more or less reach to the end of it in a firm way.

JILL PRUETZ: It's pretty precise.

NARRATOR: To make a spear, a chimp starts by breaking off a branch, then sharpening the tip, all in the quest to catch a bush baby in its daytime sleeping hollow.

JILL PRUETZ: So the next step would be that the chimp would approach the cavity and sometimes look in, take the tool, jab forcefully into the cavity, multiple times.

NARRATOR: It may not be ice-pick-sharp, but when driven by an arm up to five times as strong as a human's, it's a potentially lethal weapon.

JILL PRUETZ: They always either sniff it or lick it when they withdraw the tool. What they may do is actually break open the entire cavity and, if they're lucky, find a bush baby inside.

NARRATOR: Break, strip, sharpen, stab: these chimps take a series of distinct steps in a carefully premeditated hunt.

For Andrew Whiten, this discovery may offer a window on our own past.

ANDREW WHITEN: Hunting's fascinating to us humans, particularly if we're interested in the evolutionary story of how we got here. Our ancestor, five or six million years ago was somewhat like a chimpanzee, we know that. Then, later in the evolutionary story, we became big-game hunters, using a lot of weaponry, butchery tools. And we're bringing down large prey. So how did an animal like a puny ape reach that stage?

NARRATOR: Pruetz and Whiten are closing in on the answers. Most of the 20 spear hunts Pruetz has observed have taken place during the rainy season. Over time she has seen every stage of the kill.

A chimp is inspecting a hollow, looking for a bush baby. She breaks off a branch and makes a spear.

JILL PRUETZ: The first time I saw a chimp make a tool, I think I said something like, "Where is she going, and what is she going to do with that tool?"

NARRATOR: She nibbles the tip to sharpen it. Then, with the aid of her foot, she aims the point into a hollow.

Pruetz has made a landmark discovery. Never before has any non-human species been known to routinely make and use deadly weapons.

So what does spear-hunting reveal about how chimpanzees think? Pruetz and her team have seen about half the chimps here brandishing weapons, which means spear hunting has spread through much of the group. That seems natural to us. But generating ideas and sharing technologies? That's one scientific definition of culture.

For Whiten, culture includes the human arts from opera to Oprah, but it also covers the rudimentary traditions of ape societies.

ANDREW WHITEN: If you know enough about the behavior of an individual, you actually know where they come from. So if you know someone who wears a tartan kilt, and to play the bagpipes, if they enjoy porridge for breakfast, they probably, you can tell, come from Scotland. So if you know that a chimpanzee is one of several in its group that enjoy coming and dunking themselves in a pond, like this, and also that they sharpen sticks and actually use those as primitive kinds of weapons then, "Aha! That chimpanzee comes from Fongoli."

NARRATOR: Whiten is trying to discover what kind of mind can lead an ape to culture.

ANDREW WHITEN: Young watch their parents, sometimes very intently. And over the following months and years, they acquire that behavior. So you have to be able to copy.

NARRATOR: When apes live alongside people, they sometimes copy our behaviors naturally, without any training. Copying someone else's successful actions beats reinventing them from scratch, but it's a lot harder than it looks.

When these bonobos in the Congo started imitating each other, it seemed like play. But they were actually relying on a sophisticated skill-set for copying.

REBECCA SAXE: You see some other animal doing something that you want to do. And being able to figure out, just by watching how they're doing that, so you can do it yourself, is actually an incredibly complicated skill, with lots of steps to it.

You have to know what it is about what they're doing that leads to some goal that animal has. You have to be able to know enough about that goal to recognize that you share that goal. You have to know, "How is it physically working?" You have to know enough about your body and other bodies to be able to line them up.

NARRATOR: To prove that one ape can copy another, a student of Andrew Whiten's devised an experiment. At the Keeling Center of the University of Texas, Antoine Spiteri has built a kind of slot machine for apes. He loads it with a grape.

To get the fruit, a chimp must first turn a disk to allow the grape to drop through a hole. Next, a chimp has to move a handle that opens a door to release the fruit pay-out.

Spiteri now trains a chimp named Judy how to work the device. On her own, she'd never figure it out, but thanks to a sweet liquid reward, she learns the sequence of two steps: rotate, then push. Ka-ching!

Next, Judy's group mates enter the corral. Spiteri wants to know if, just by watching, the chimps in the peanut gallery will learn the technique. Can these apes ape to win this food-finding game? One chimp seems to think she's got it and shoves Judy aside.

A minute ago, Judy was the only one with the knowledge. Now another has it, and, quickly, the trick spreads throughout the group.

But for Spiteri, the most important question remains. Have the kibitzers next door also learned the solution? They have no social ties to the original group. In fact, they are hostile to them. Would they set that aside to keep with the Joneses next door?

In no time flat, they're working the slot machine like old pros. Rotate. Then push the handle. Call it the Texas two-step.

Learning by imitation is an essential skill for culture. And culture, along with the complex thoughts and emotions behind it, were long believed to be uniquely human.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: The history of Western thought has always been premised on the idea that there are beasts and there are humans; and humans are touched by the spark of God, and beasts are just beasts.

NARRATOR: Something of a revolution came in 1960, when a young researcher, with support from the National Geographic Society, set up camp in Tanzania. Jane Goodall observed that chimps' emotions seemed much like ours, especially the tenacious bond between mother and baby.

At a site called Bossou, in Western Africa, Japanese researchers recorded the story of an ill two-year-old chimp. Her mother touches her forehead as if to check for fever. As the baby's strength ebbs her mother remains devoted.

TETSURO MATSUZAWA (Kyoto University): When I see the scene of the mother looking at the baby, I really recognize the emotional life of chimpanzees are so similar to us.

NARRATOR: For weeks after the baby's death, her mother carries the body. Is the mother grieving? Defiant? Can an ape be in denial? It's impossible to say exactly what the mother is thinking, but hard to dismiss her feelings.

Putting ape emotions on the map was only one of Goodall's accomplishments. She also found powerful evidence of their intelligence. Goodall was the first to report chimps making and using tools—in this case to "fish" for termites.

TETSURO MATSUZAWA: When she found termite-fishing, people were so surprised, and thought we should change the definition of humans, or we should include chimpanzee as humans.

NARRATOR: What Goodall couldn't have known was that at a place called Goualougo, other chimps had an even more sophisticated way to catch termites. First they use a big stick like a shovel to open the ground, then they switch to a slender probe to pull up the insects.

Perhaps Goodall's most astonishing discovery was that chimps are hunters. She watched a troop catching colobus monkeys by hand.

Although no one has established that they actually coordinate their efforts, the chimps seem to be cooperating. And cooperation is, after all, one of the key drivers of human culture. Could apes rev up their culture by working together? Imagine a group of chimps, armed and dangerous, hunting as a band.

So why isn't Earth Planet of the Apes?

Do apes even have the capacity to cooperate? A series of new studies reveals the rudiments of teamwork in the great apes. But they still come up short.

In an experiment at the Great Ape Research Institute in Japan, a chimp knows that food is hidden under a stone. Then researchers swap in a heavier stone. If two chimps each know about the food, can they work together?

In repeated trials, no pair of chimps ever communicated to synchronize their pulling. Swap in a person—researcher Satoshi Hirata—and chimps still don't collaborate, at first. But, eventually, they figured out the sweet rewards of cooperation. Ultimately, the chimps learned to ask for a helping hand.

A needy chimp may recruit help from a person, but will it ever offer assistance?

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: One of the most surprising findings of all of my years of studying apes has been that they will actually help humans. If you're reaching for an out-of-reach object, if they understand what your goal is, then they will help you.

NARRATOR: Of course if you've dropped your banana, forget it, you won't get it back.

Chimps can understand what someone else wants. And one study shows that they can even interpret another's actions as good or bad.

In Leipzig, Germany, a chimpanzee is about to receive a tray of monkey chow. At the same time he's given a rope under the platform he can pull anytime to collapse the platform and end the experiment. Another chimp now enters the cage. This chimp is free to pull a second rope on top of the tray. The first chimp is ticked off. He pulls the hidden rope, and the game's over.

Was he just generally outraged? Or was he taking specific revenge on the thief? To find out, the researcher now moves the food. Once again the first chimp has lost his food to the second. All that's changed is who's responsible.

In trials where the researcher moves the chow, the first chimp is much less likely to crash the platform. That would punish an innocent chimp who had no intent to do him wrong.

JOSEP CALL: They can gauge who is responsible for something that has been done. Humans make a big distinction on...intentions are very important for humans. For instance, take the case...in our judicial system, manslaughter and murder; the difference between those two is simply the intent.

NARRATOR: So chimps have a sense of justice, and they can cooperate with people. Can they collaborate spontaneously with each other?

Researchers, also from the Max Planck Institute, placed fruit on a board just out of a chimpanzee's reach. The chimps are behind bars, both to keep them from the food, and because they can be impulsive, strong and dangerous.

When a solo chimp can reach both ends of a rope, it hauls them in and gets all the food. But on some trials the ends are too far apart. If the chimp pulls just one end, the rope unthreads.

The chimp has another option. He can unlock a door to bring in a helper who's been watching. The two chimps now work together.

But a series of trials shows that this teamwork doesn't come easily. The helper must be a friend, and the food divided into separate dishes.

Can a more loving ape cooperate better? At Lola Ya Bonobo Sanctuary in the Congo, victims of the pet trade are raised by human mothers. When these bonobos grow up, they will spend their days outdoors, becoming savvy about life in the forest. Bonobos are the most social of the great apes. And in their groups, all friends are "friends with benefits," a simple way to diffuse tension.

Calmer than chimps, how do bonobos do on the cooperation test? Brian Hare places food in a central shared well.

BRIAN HARE: All the food is in the same dish, so it's very easy for one individual to bump the other individual out of the way and steal it all.

NARRATOR: It takes the bonobos a while to get on task. But soon they get the hang of it.

BRIAN & ESTHER : Yay, bonobos! Yay!

NARRATOR: With their more congenial temperaments, bonobos are more cooperative than chimps are. In fact, bonobos may take cooperation even further.

When a young male died at Lola Ya Bonobo, workers were trying to remove his body.

BRIAN HARE: The staff decided to use sticks and try to move the bonobo towards a door. They mounted an incredible defense of this body that surprised everybody and was extremely moving. That's a fascinating reaction on the part of the bonobos. They were not related to that individual, and yet, they took extreme risks to protect his body.

NARRATOR: As they fend off the humans, it seems as if they're cooperating. But what does it take to work together? Are they comparing the number of staff to their own troops? Can they calculate at all?

At Kyoto University, Tetsuro Matsuzawa's experiments are revealing that chimps can in fact develop an astonishing facility for numbers. He first trained a chimpanzee named Ai to touch the numeral that matched the number of dots. Once Ai knew zero through nine, Matsuzawa displayed the numerals helter-skelter on a screen. Ai quickly learned to touch them in ascending order.

In the final test, Matsuzawa piled on. As soon as Ai touches the numeral one, white squares cover up the remaining numerals. Can the chimp possibly remember all the locations and touch them in order?

TETSURO MATSUZAWA: The performance was really amazing. Much, much better than we had expected.

NARRATOR: But for Ai, learning numbers was a struggle.

TETSURO MATSUZAWA: Almost the same amount of training was necessary to teach three, teach four or teach five. Or, even worse, it takes more time to teach five and then six.

NARRATOR: Ai never got the "aha" feeling that children have when they realize that you just add one to get to the next number.

In the United States, another ape shows a surprising gift for language.

SUE SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH: Going to go help get some sticks? Good.

NARRATOR: A bonobo named Kanzi, now at the Great Ape Trust in Iowa, picked up English without being directly taught.

SUE SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH: Put the keys in the refrigerator.

NARRATOR: Wearing a mask to avoid cueing Kanzi, researcher Sue Savage-Rumbaugh tests his comprehension.

SUE SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH: Good job!

Go get the ball that's outdoors.

Very nice. Thank you, Kanzi.

NARRATOR: Savage-Rumbaugh measures Kanzi's vocabulary at 3,000 spoken English words.

While apes can master words and numbers, other research shows that something else is limiting their cooperation: apes have emotional issues—rivalry, violence—and most of all, they're impulsive.

In a celebrated study that investigated impulse control, Sally Boysen of Ohio State University asked chimps to choose between two dishes of M&Ms®.

SALLY BOYSEN: Now, you watch real carefully. We're going to put one, two, three, four down here. Are you watching, Miss Priss? Sheeby? And we're going to put two in here.

Give those to Sarah. Okay.

Well, I have to give these to Sarah, and Sheeba gets two. So Sarah gets four and Sheeba only gets two. Aw, too bad.

NARRATOR: The twist was that the chimp got the candy she didn't point to. Could the chimp learn to resist her impulse to reach for the bigger pile?

SALLY BOYSEN: You want Sarah to have these? It's okay, it's okay. You get to have that one. Yeah, Sarah gets five, and Sheba gets one. Oh, that is such a shame.

NARRATOR: Amazingly, chimps never overcame their greedy urges. They always reached for more and, so, ended up with less.

SALLY BOYSEN: And Sheba gets two, so Sarah gets four. See?

NARRATOR: Impulse studies have also been run on humans. In a classic experiment from the 1970s, a researcher gave a four-year-old a simple choice.

RESEARCHER : So, if you wait for me to get back, I'll give you this bowl with all of these gummy bears, okay? But if you can't wait, you can push that button, like this, and then I'll come back and you can have this bowl with just this one gummy bear, okay? Okay, I'll be right back.

NARRATOR: According to an inconclusive but intriguing study, the longer children resisted temptation, the higher their S.A.T. scores were years later. In any case, the differences between people are small compared to the gap separating humans and apes.

BRIAN HARE: Maybe one of the first things that happened during our species evolution is we became much less emotionally reactive. And maybe that's one of the big differences that may explain why we solve problems so differently. We sort of got control of our emotions.

NARRATOR: Can apes be given skills to help them master their emotions? Sally Boysen trained a chimp to understand numerals. Then she repeated her M&Ms experiment, but now offered different pairs of numerals rather than treats.

SALLY BOYSEN: You want to give two to Sarah? Okay. Two goes to Sarah, and you get six.

NARRATOR: Remarkably, chimps were now able to learn what they couldn't before: point to the smaller number to get the bigger prize.

Symbols can make you free. They can help distance an ape from its impulses. But outside of the lab, apes don't seem to use symbols. Still, ape minds seem to share many of the amazing features of the human mind. They have sophisticated social emotions. They can cooperate. They have culture.

Their mental rocket is on the launch pad. Why isn't it taking off?

The human brain rocket certainly had lift-off. On an average day, human beings file thousands of patents, post tens of thousands of internet videos, and think millions of thoughts that have never been thought before.

Our closest relatives are different. On a good day, an ape is lucky to use a tool to crack a nut. What prevents ape culture from igniting like the human version?

Recent studies that compare the human and ape minds are revealing something surprising. Bonobos like Kanzi show their own kind of genius.

SALLY BOYSEN: Kanzi, could you take off Sue's shoe? Could you take my shoe off, please? You might need to untie it.

NARRATOR: Even skeptics agree that Kanzi understands more words than any other non-human animal. He also uses an array of visual symbols to communicate. But on closer inspection, Kanzi, like all great apes, lacks the full mental package.

Take Kanzi's use of language.

JOSEP CALL: Most of the time, he will use these symbols to request things, to say "Take me there," or "Give me that." Now, Kanzi will not use those symbols to talk about the weather or to just make small talk, which is a very human thing.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: When human infants communicate with others, they engage in a real conversation where each conversational turn is responsive to the turn that came before. And they even ask for clarification if they need. So you say "Huh?" or you say "Yeah," and you let the other one know how the communication is going.

NARRATOR: To engage in a real conversation, each speaker needs a sense of what the other is thinking. Call this skill mind-reading.

Young children haven't fully developed it.

RESEARCHER: Hey, so Zoe, guess what we're going to do today? We're going to play a game with my Princess Sally here. See, this is Princess Sally. And she's got a ball that she really likes. This is her ball. But she needs to go away for a little bit, so Princess Sally is going to hide her ball right over here in the bag. See Princess Sally hiding her ball right over there in the purple bag? Yeah?

So here she goes. She's going to go away for just a little bit. Now while Princess Sally is away, we're going to play a little trick on her, okay? We're going to move her ball from the purple bag over here to the green bag. See how we moved the ball over there? Okay, so guess what? Princess Sally is coming back. Here she is. She came back. Can you tell me, where is Princess Sally going to first look for her ball? Over here in the green bag? Can you tell me, why is Princess Sally...

NARRATOR: Classic studies showed that three-year-olds make consistent mistakes about what others know.

REBECCA SAXE: The thing that's amazing about three-year-olds is how convinced they are about their wrong answer. They're so sure that she's going to look for her ball where it really is because she wants it and that's where it is.

NARRATOR: But by the age of four, most children are accomplished mind-readers.

RESEARCHER: Where is Sally first going to look for her ball?

BOY: She's going to look in the purple bag, so she can find her ball.

SALLY BOYSEN: She's going to look in the purple bag?

NARRATOR: That's the right answer.

As recently as 2001, studies seemed to show that apes don't know what others are thinking. But then new experiments began to reveal unexpected skills.

In one study, as a chimp approached a treat, Brian Hare moved it out of reach, establishing himself as a competitor. Next Hare blocked his own view of one treat but left another in his sight.

BRIAN HARE: It looks like they're generating a plan and saying to themselves, "Okay, I want that food, and the one I'm most likely to get is the one he's not looking at, or the one that, if I sneak around, he won't see me, and therefore I can have my yummy banana treat."

NARRATOR: This chimp seems to know what's on Hare's mind, what he can see and what he can't. So chimps seem to share a bit of our talent for mind-reading.

Do we have any mental skills that are uniquely our own?

A key clue comes from a new experiment. Back at the University of Texas, Victoria Horner shows a chimp how to operate a puzzle box to get a piece of candy.

First, she taps. Then she slides. Next she pokes.

The chimp copies pretty well and gets the sweet.

DEREK: This game we're going to play is about this special box I brought, alright? There's a gummy bear. It's your turn.

NARRATOR: Children copy the actions, much as the chimps did.

DEREK: Look, you got him. Alright! There's the gummy bear. Good job.

VICTORIA HORNER (Emory University/ University of St. Andrews): The second box that I show the chimpanzees is this one, and it's identical to the opaque box except that it's made out of material which is see-through.

NARRATOR: Only now is it obvious that Horner's tapping and poking don't achieve a thing: the box has a false ceiling.

The chimps cut to the chase. They skip the needless steps. For the apes it's all about the treat.

ANDREW WHITEN: What this study shows is that apes don't just mindlessly ape. They also understand something more about cause and effect.

VICTORIA HORNER: We found something quite surprising. The children were pre-disposed to copy, even when it meant that they were doing something that was really rather silly. So this seems a little like the chimps are outsmarting the kids in this particular study.

DEREK: There he is. You got him out.

NARRATOR: Why do kids imitate slavishly?

VICTORIA HORNER: At the root of the children's behavior is the fact that they viewed me as a grownup, possibly as a teacher.

NARRATOR: That children expect to be taught is a vital difference. While apes can copy, most researchers believe they don't teach each other. Learning from someone else is the fastest way to get a new idea: faster than learning by imitation, faster than inventing a new technology in the first place.

In children, a penchant for teaching appears—even before language kicks in—in the form of a deceptively simply gesture: pointing. A toddler knows that the cup being pointed to is the one that hides a treat.

REBECCA SAXE: Parents love it when their kids start pointing because it's evidence that the kid's trying to communicate with them. Parents definitely notice the difference between babies who just point to ask for things and babies who point to show them things.

NARRATOR: Apes don't seem to get that kind of pointing. It doesn't matter whether Brian Hare points or stares or orients his body, this young bonobo can't fathom that he is trying to communicate.

BRIAN HARE: They were clueless at using the information. Even after lots and lots of trials, they didn't use the information I provided them. And it was a big surprise to everybody.

NARRATOR: But Hare suspected a certain domesticated animal would succeed.

BRIAN HARE: I sort of was thinking to myself, "Well, wait a second. I have a dog at home. And, you know, he plays fetch. And when he loses his ball, he comes and looks at me. And if I point in a certain direction, he runs off in that direction and tries to find the ball."

NARRATOR: Sure enough, dogs get it.

Why dogs and people but not apes? The answer may spring from the way emotions collide with reason.

BRIAN HARE: It's possible that, like dogs, there may have been selection against aggression in humans, and selection for tolerant behavior, pro-social behavior, that actually then allowed us to use these cooperative communicative cues in a very different way than other species, even our closest relatives.

NARRATOR: Pointing has a rational component too. It relies on a particular mental skill, a little difference that makes a big difference.

BRIAN HARE: Whenever I point, I'm actually directing your attention towards a third object. And you have to understand that my attention is on that object, and that I'm asking you, now, to attend to the same object. So there's sort of a triangle between us and the object.

NARRATOR: This mental skill, call it "the triangle," turbocharges teamwork.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: What you'll see with the human mother and baby is that the mother is constantly trying to show the baby what to do, and the baby is trying to tune into what the mother wants. And so you have a full triangle of mother and baby and the thing in the environment that they are trying to work on.

REBECCA SAXE: It's a special cognitive achievement. For some reason kids do this naturally, almost immediately. And curiously, apes can't get into that.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: At the moment we have no evidence that apes have shared goals based on shared commitments. They do things together, they coordinate their actions together, but they don't have a shared commitment to a shared goal.

NARRATOR: The triangle is the core skill that makes teaching possible. Humans have it; apes seem to lack it. But apes are also missing one more thing. It's a key emotional driver: the passion to cheer each other on.

TETSURO MATSUZAWA: "Good," "good job," "well done." This kind of facilitation, giving a hand, encouragement, is the base of teaching.

REBECCA SAXE: It seems like it's not just a cognitive capacity that's necessary for teaching. There's this other thing, which is wanting to teach, that seems to be really pervasive in humans and maybe mysteriously missing in apes.

NARRATOR: The pieces are now coming together. Apes have culture, a rare achievement in the animal world. They can learn from each other by imitation. But this process is passive, often slow and can easily backslide.

BRIAN HARE: Probably there's a lot of slippage. There's a lot of loss of cultural innovations between generations when you're talking about a chimpanzee.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: If an ape invents something new and important and interesting, maybe some others will learn it, maybe they won't.

NARRATOR: Unique among animals, humans have both the passion and mental skill to teach each other. When you're a student rather than a spectator, learning jumps to warp speed. That's because teaching locks in progress.

MICHAEL TOMASELLO: Human culture traditions have a cumulative quality that each generation builds on the things of the previous generation. So if you looked at the history of any interesting technology, it started out simple, and the children of that generation learned the simple version. But then some genius made an improvement to it, and everyone follows right away, and we get this ratcheting up in complexity.

NARRATOR: An ape may stand on another's shoulders, but only humans can stand on the intellectual shoulders of giants.

BRIAN HARE: It's such a great privilege to be able to work with these animals and try to understand what's going on in their head when they look at you so gingerly and softly. Is it they're thinking, "Oh, he's such a nice guy, and boy, I wish I knew what was going on in his head?" Or is she thinking, "Gosh, what's that spot? Is it dirt? Could I eat that?"

NARRATOR: In spite of their limitations, when we look into the eyes of a fellow ape, we don't feel a gap but a deep connection. We can't dismiss a chimp reaching out for help, or a group of unrelated bonobos rallying to the defense of another, or a mother refusing to let go of her dead baby. But as the most social of apes, we can't help reading thoughts and feelings into the mind behind any familiar face.

And perhaps that says more about us than them.

ANNOUNCER: Tonight on NOVA, a dog gets a new hip. An ape gets a physical exam.

HAYLEY WESTON: It's hard to not react when you're getting gorilla feces shot in your face.

ANNOUNCER: And a foal gets a second chance.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: If this baby had stayed at home, it would have died. Is she breathing OK?

ANNOUNCER: Be on the front lines of veterinary care with the students and doctors of the Animal Hospital.

Major funding for NOVA is provided by the Park Foundation. Dedicated to education and quality television.

This program is funded in part by Northwestern Mutual Life, which has been protecting families and businesses for generations. Have you heard from the Quiet Company? Northwestern Mutual Life.

And by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and viewers like you.

OWNER: How does she look, Jake?

OWNER: I don't know. She doesn't look so good.

NARRATOR: This is the other ER. It's the animal hospital of Tufts Veterinary School outside of Boston.

VETERINARIAN: She was hit by a car. And what are her pulses?

NARRATOR: And it's every bit as advanced as a hospital for humans. Here, animals can take advantage of all the latest medical technology available to people, from intensive care to sports medicine, radiology to surgery. This is also a teaching hospital for some of the country's brightest veterinary students, who undergo four rigorous years of medical training to earn their degrees. Today, after three years of basic science, students move out of the classroom and into the clinic. For the next 12 months, NOVA will follow these students as they receive hands-on training in virtually every specialty of modern veterinary medicine. A newborn foal arrives, struggling for her life. And it's Mike Thibodeau's first day in the clinic. Mike has never spent any time around horses. But now, he's on the spot.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: I don't get the impression that Mike is a horse person. And so, not only does he have to remember all the medical things he learned in the last three years. He has to adjust to working with larger animals than dogs and cats.

MIKE THIBODEAU: All right, so the foal's ten days old—was ten days premature, right?

MARY ROSE PARADIS: Right.

MIKE THIBODEAU: It was born...

OWNER: This morning.

MIKE THIBODEAU: This morning. Did it stand at all?

OWNER: Not on its own.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: Do you know when they should stand? How old should they be?

MIKE THIBODEAU: Like, three hours?

MARY ROSE PARADIS: Right. OK, so anything longer than three hours is abnormal.

MIKE THIBODEAU: The doctors immediately thought it was probably a dummy foal, which means maybe during birth, it lost oxygen somehow for a period of time, or at least had low oxygen levels, and it knocked his brain off a little bit.

NARRATOR: The lack of oxygen causes the brain to swell, and the foal becomes unable to stand and nurse from its mother. No milk means no antibodies and no protection against infection.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: And so, our first step is to make sure that it has protection against the bacteria. And that's in the form of a transfusion with plasma, antibiotics. And then, we have to worry about nutrition, because these babies, if you don't have enough glucose, they're going to die from hypoglycemia. So, you have to think of all of these things at once.

MIKE THIBODEAU: The mother seems fine. Some of them will, you know, maybe get a little nervous around you going near their baby.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: We generally like to keep the mom close, because it keeps her quieter. If you take her away from her baby, she'll start yelling and screaming and creating quite a ruckus, and then when we introduce the baby back, she might not be as happy about it. And so, as long as we can keep the maternal bond with the mare and the foal, then we're much happier. And the mare is much happier.

NARRATOR: Even with fluids and antibiotics, the foal is not out of danger. Her brain is still swollen, and x-rays of her lungs reveal more bad news. She has pneumonia. There are no guarantees that either problem can be cured.

MARY ROSE PARADIS: Babies are funny creatures. They can die—She could die in an hour without giving us much warning. Or she could be standing and romping around the stall tomorrow. If this baby had stayed at home, it would have died. I mean, if it had stayed at home even another four hours, it probably would have died. And so, the fact that she might walk out the door makes you feel like you're doing something for these animals.

NARRATOR: It will be hours before they know if the drugs will cure the pneumonia, and if the swelling in the foal's brain will go down. Mike has a long night ahead of him.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: We can palpate his quadriceps muscles.

NARRATOR: A dog with a painful hip is being seen by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Randy Boudrieau, assisted by fourth-year student Marvelyn Motamed. Schatzie is an eight-year-old German Shepherd.

SHELLY LOWRY: Schatzie loves to play Frisbee. She loves to run. I noticed she began to limp. She was favoring her left hind leg.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: OK, there we go.

NARRATOR: The first step is to check the range of motion in Schatzie's hip.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: OK, girl. We're almost done.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: You can't pull her hip as far out as you should be able to. You can't pull it forward as far as you should be able to.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: Let's try to lift the leg up and back. Not too bad over here, although a little bit of discomfort.

NARRATOR: Dr. Boudrieau suspects that Schatzie's hip joint is worn down, a problem common in large dogs.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: All right, these are radiographs of Schatzie's hips. What we're seeing primarily is that we do not have a good fit to the hip joint, which is normally a ball and socket joint. The ball is not seated deeply enough within the socket. This is the socket in a normal dog. You can see how smooth and round everything is in this particular case. If we look at just a half of the bone of a dog that had severe arthritic changes, and you notice that there's really no socket that's even present. And this is the femoral head and the proximal portion of the femur. And you can see what normally had happened here is that the socket is gone, and this piece of bone was resting across here, and there was really no hip joint in this particular animal.

NARRATOR: Schatzie's hip isn't that bad yet. But it still has to be replaced. The operation is the same one done on people.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: What we're doing is placing a polyethylene cup and then implant the cup with some bone cement that actually acts more as a mortar to hold everything in place. We do the same thing on the opposite side, which is with the femur. We actually implant a stainless steel ball that has a stem that actually goes right down inside the shaft. Here's the femur, again with the femoral head implanted. And this is the articulation that will develop. And still, Schatzie's still a little bit bigger than what we have here. But this is what we're after here.

SHELLY LOWRY: (to Schatzie) You're going to feel so much better when all this is done. You'll be able to run, play Frisbee, and frolic with Zeta.

NARRATOR: The operation will last two hours. Schatzie's new hip will last for the rest of her life. The first thing to go is the ball at the top of Schatzie's leg bone.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: I've removed the ball of the ball and socket joint. There's a fair amount of wear right—If you look right on the surface right here, you can see that the articular cartilage right over from this area here is gone. The articular cartilage starts right about there. And this area here, it looks pretty shiny. That's because it's highly polished bone. That's what has been rubbing on the acetabulum. What we're going to do here is go ahead and ream out the socket so that we have the appropriate size cup that can fit in here.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: So, the prosthetic socket is like a piece of plastic, and they use some cement, special cement that they pour in that area. And then, they stick the socket in, the piece of plastic in.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: So now, we just have to wait 13 minutes for when this thing will set up. What we've done is implanted our polyethylene cup. It's in position. The cement's already in place. Our plan at this point is to go back to the femoral side.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: For the ball part, they drill a hole down into the bone, pour cement in there, and then stick in the prosthetic ball in there.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: This is the actual head, which is identical to the one that we just removed.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: So, now, you have a fake ball and a fake socket that should—You know, if they're angled right and everything is perfect and the cement stays in well, then everything should work out and the animal should have better support.

RANDY BOUDRIEAU: This is the neck. The stem goes down into the femur. Here is the head, which is seated within the acetabulum which has been cemented on that side. So, simply making sure that everything looks appropriate, which it does. That moves nicely.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: She's going to be resting right now. For the next day, she'll get pain medication. It's going to take her a good eight weeks to fully recover, and probably to do what she normally does, her normal activity as far as running and Frisbee and stuff like that.

NARRATOR: Five days later, Schatzie is ready to put the whole experience behind her.

SHELLY LOWRY: I think she's feeling a whole lot better today. She says, "I've been here long enough. I want to sleep in my own bed."

NARRATOR: Over in oncology, Rosario Delgado-Lecároz is feeling overwhelmed. She is about to go through a vet school rite of passage, seeing her first patient and its owner all by herself.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: There are so many drugs in oncology. I have to measure, somehow, the lymph nodes. I have no idea how. I mean, it can't be that complicated. You just go like that, I hope. It's a good dog, too.

SUE COTTER: I think sometimes this can be a little bit overwhelming for a student when they are rotating through all these different specialties here. For example, in oncology, we do have a lot of different treatments. And you know, when an animal perhaps relapses, we may have to go to other approaches and then go back and re-discuss everything with owners.

NARRATOR: Ebony is a seven-year-old German Shepherd with cancer of the lymphatic system. He was treated with chemotherapy more than a year ago. But now, his cancer is back.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: So, how is he? Does he still have the diarrhea?

OWNER: No. No.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: It went away?

OWNER: Good, yeah.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Has he been eating OK?

OWNER: Oh, yeah.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Eating and drinking OK?

OWNER: Mmm-hmm.

SUE COTTER: When you first go in, the student is always in a tough position, because the owners know that they're students, and the owners sometimes are a little uncomfortable, although I think Rosario is particularly good at interacting with people.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Oh, he's so tense.

OWNER: Yeah. (laughter)

SUE COTTER: Dogs and cats do get a lot of cancer. It's usually middle-aged or older dogs. It's probably one of the most common, if not the most common, cause of death in old dogs and cats, probably because they're living longer now than they used to. They have better nutrition, better medical care. They don't have the cardiovascular diseases people have. And I think if people didn't have heart disease and strokes, they'd have probably cancer as their highest cause of death.

NARRATOR: The latest weapon to combat cancer is a linear accelerator. A hand-me-down from a human hospital, it is one of the first to become available for precision radiation therapy in animals.

SUE COTTER: We can treat deeper cancers. We can spare normal tissues like skin, for example. So, hopefully, it will give us a better variety of ways that we can treat tumors, and better precision and fewer side effects. Each cancer is an individual disease. Breast cancer is very different from lymphoma, very different from leukemia. Some are treated with surgery, some with radiation. Some are treated with chemotherapy, some with various combinations of all of that.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: We're going to give an anti-tumor drug. It's just going to try to kill all the cells that are multiplying too much. And that's what the drug's going to do. And it has some side effects that you have to monitor.

NARRATOR: Ebony's chemotherapy uses the same cancer drug prescribed for people. But animals don't have to worry about their hair falling out. It's given by injection every few weeks, and it costs several thousand dollars.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money that goes into the treatment. But then again, I mean, some animals are some families' babies.

OWNER: We're going to fight it as long as we can.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: It's just a matter of making their life longer, because they will die from this.

OWNER: We'll get a few more years out of him.

SUE COTTER: When students graduate, we're really expecting to turn out someone who can be a general practitioner. We're not really expecting to turn out a specialist. I think the important thing that they should get out of the rotation is, what are the big issues from what are the little issues. And I think as students go through their fourth year, they get better at doing that. You know, we don't expect them, in the beginning of the fourth year, to know all of this or there would be no reason to have a fourth year.

TERESE RIORDAN: Ever since I was a kid, I've always just liked pigs. It's just that they're so cute. In order to have a pet pig, you definitely have to be a pig person. (To Wilbur) Wilbur, sit. I said, sit. All the way back. They are high maintenance from the standpoint that they like attention. As Wilbur has gotten older—Well, he's four now—But he started to have a behavior problem when he was about three, mostly with my brother.

STEPHEN: That time, I got teeth!

TERESE RIORDAN: Stephen can never come over to my house if Wilbur is always going after him. But I'm also worried that eventually it will be to everybody, and not just him or my neighbor or certain few people. It will be to everybody. So, obviously, I want to get it fixed.

NARRATOR: Behavior problems are as common as medical problems. And as Marvelyn is about to find out, they can be just as difficult to treat. Wilbur's owner has called in pet therapist, Dr. Stefanie Schwartz.

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: Has he ever been destructive with the furniture at all?

TERESE RIORDAN: No.

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: Do you ever yell at him? Do you ever say, "No, bad pig"?

TERESE RIORDAN: I mean, depending on how it is, or how the other person reacts, I might just say, "Wilbur..." sometimes.

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: How do you say it? Let me hear what it sounds like.

TERESE RIORDAN: Well, a lot of times, I'll hold his snout, and I'll, you know, "Wilbur," and really, you know, try to be a little loud. I mean, I'll grab his snout.

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: And what does he do when you do that?

TERESE RIORDAN: Oh, he tries to, you know, wriggle out of my hand. Oh, oh, oh, Wilbur. Oh...

MARVELYN MOTAMED: When I work with pigs in veterinary school, they're very inquisitive. They're very smart, and I think they could make good pets. But probably most people that get pigs would not have the proper environment for them.

TERESE RIORDAN: Oh, Wilbur!

NARRATOR: To fully appreciate all of Wilbur's talents, Dr. Schwartz asks to see him in action.

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: All right.

TERESE RIORDAN: That's it?

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: That's enough for me.

STEPHEN: That's enough for me. (laughter)

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: What's going on here is that Wilbur began to exhibit normal behaviors for pigs. Except that the behavior was unfortunately directed towards another person. To Wilbur's point of view, Steve is a threat to his dominant status in this herd. Another thing that's interesting is that you are actually reinforcing this undesirable behavior in him. The ritual in greeting is for submissive members to scratch the belly of the pig. And then, the dominant animal actually lies down and allows submissive animals to scratch his belly. So, you've been reinforcing his dominance over you.

TERESE RIORDAN: By scratching his belly?

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: Correct. You fed right into his little scheme of things.

TERESE RIORDAN: Yeah. Now, is it too late?

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: Is it too late? No, I don't think it's too late. No. You've got to get him to understand that he is no longer chairman of the board, and that he's got to go back down to the mailroom. First of all, no more rubbing his belly. You understand that that reinforces his dominance?

TERESE RIORDAN: I mean, what about other people? I mean, nobody should be rubbing his belly?

STEFANIE SCHWARTZ: Nobody should rub his belly.

TERESE RIORDAN: Humph.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: I don't think you can get them out of that. I honestly don't think she's going to be able to—that pig, you know, there's any help for that. She's is not going to be there all the time that he attacks someone or that he does something mean. And you saw how wimpy she was when she was trying to tell him no. Yeah, she's going to have to either lock him up or get rid of him. Lock him up every time someone comes to the house.

NARRATOR: If Terese is to become the leader of the herd, as Dr. Schwartz recommended, Wilbur can expect to see some changes around the house: more exercise, fewer treats, and no more belly rubs.

TERESE RIORDAN: I mean, it's going to be hard, because I like to give him belly rubs. So, that will be hard. It will be a pain to always keep him on the leash as far as, when someone comes in, I've got to stand there and hold him all the time. But you know, I'd rather that for six months or a year than to have my friends say, "I don't want to come over because I don't like your pig."

NARRATOR: The animal hospital is a mecca for race horses. When these expensive athletes under-perform, they are brought to the large animal clinic for investigation. Spanish Dancer is a thoroughbred racer who has come to the hospital with colic, a severe pain in the abdomen. Student Marina Cesar's first job is to threat eight feet of tubing up this mare's nose.

DR. MELISSA MAZAN: Marina, why are we doing this?

MARINA CESAR: To decompress her stomach, because it gets filled with fluid and causes a lot of pain.

NARRATOR: Horses can't vomit, so the first step is to siphon off the contents of the stomach.

MARINA CESAR: Here we go.

NARRATOR: Having relieved pressure there, the next step is to tackle the manure that is stuck in the horse's large intestine. Since laxatives have failed to do the job, the surgeons have been called in.

MARINA CESAR: She's been sedated. So now, we're just waiting for that to take effect, and then we're going to give her some more drugs. And then, she'll drop. As her head drops, that's a sign that she's becoming more and more sedated. They're giving ketamine, which is a drug that is going to allow her to fall down now. It's actually the same drug as angel dust.

ENDA CURRID: Horses present a very unique challenge for the surgeons, because in many ways, they're a designer's nightmare. Horses are large, large animals, so they represent a large obstacle, just in terms of moving them about when they're anesthetized. Horses have a huge bodies, and they're supported on four, what are usually very, very skinny and stick-like legs. So, they're very fragile animals, and that's something we have to think about all the time. We really don't like to keep horses under anesthesia for any more than about three to four hours maximum. And the reason for that is, when a horse lies on its back or side for more than that period of time, we risk really damaging the muscles in that horse. We get a lot of muscular swelling. Horses can recover extremely sore. It's like if you and I had severe muscle cramps.

MARINA CESAR: It's just extraordinary that they can do that. They can open the abdomen and take all the, you know, guts out and put it back in, right back where it was. A lot of times, owners will watch, and they're just flabbergasted that we do that.

DR. JEFFREY ZARUBY: From the physical exam, our impression was that this was a large colon problem. So, that's what we're pulling out right now. This is all impacted with feed material. The thing that we always wonder about is why it's impacted, whether there's a twist at the base of the colon. So, we take the large colon and exteriorize it from the abdomen and place it on this tray. And then, I'm going to make an incision and we pass tubes up the large colon and evacuate the feed material.

NARRATOR: Domesticated horses are very sensitive to their feed. Any sudden change in diet can lead to a blockage.

MARINA CESAR: And then, what we're going to do is just make an incision through the gut and just flush everything out.

DR. JEFFREY ZARUBY: I'm going to go up ventrally first.

MARINA CESAR: What we do is, we stick a hose up there and just literally flush the contents out.

DR. JEFFREY ZARUBY: Well, it's not a glamorous job, as you can see.

NARRATOR: Twenty gallons lighter, the colon can be sewn up, and put back where it belongs.

ENDA CURRID: The thing about the colon is that you really do want to get it back into the right place again. It has a quite a specific orientation around the stomach—right around the abdomen. So, you want to get the pelvic flexure, which is where we made our incision, back in this area of the intestine. Then, you want to make sure that it's all lying not twisted and not upside down. That's what I'm doing right now.

NARRATOR: Students assisting in surgery often get to sew up their patients. But here, too much is at stake.

DR. JEFFREY ZARUBY: There's only one layer that has any strength that holds all the viscera in, so if you have any problems with the closure—when they're standing up from recovery or days after the road—if they eviscerate, all their gut contents fall on the ground. So, we tend to be quite meticulous about doing this ourselves rather than having the students close the midline.

MARINA CESAR: Well, I got to put my hand in there, which is good to get practice, because that's the whole art of it, is being able to feel and use your hands to find what part of the bowel you want. Nothing was really found, but I think we fixed her. I think she's going to do better now. I wish I could have done more, but you know, it's hard to do a lot in that type of a surgery. Hopefully, she'll recover soon, and she'll be back in her stall and she'll be eating...and back to the races.

NARRATOR: It only takes four hours, and the horse is up on its feet, well along the road to recovery.

MARINA CESAR: (to Spanish Dancer) Good girl. Yes.

NARRATOR: And Mike is seeing encouraging results in his young patient, too.

MIKE THIBODEAU: And now, with some fluids and some antibiotics, we've gotten her up. She's standing. She's walking on her own now a little bit, you know, with a little bit of help, still a little wobbly. And that's what we want. You know, she seems to know who mom is. She's doing very well. And as you can see, she's got a little bit of strength right now, too. If another foal came in tomorrow and they said, "Oh, Mike do the work-up on this one. Do the physical," I think I'd feel more secure than I was yesterday when they said, "All right, here, do the physical." And I didn't know what to expect. Now, you know, working with one for the last 24 to 48 hours, I've definitely got more of a feel what it is working with a foal and what to look for.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: He used to just sit in my lap. I don't know if he'll do that anymore.

NARRATOR: Jake is a three-month-old Chocolate Labrador who is suffering from violent seizures. No one can figure out why. In the last few days, his seizures have been getting worse.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: He moves around quite a lot. And when he gets up, he's very disoriented. He walks into walls.

NARRATOR: His owner, Janet Kirkpatrick, is thinking of having Jake put to sleep. But fourth-year student Noelle La Croix has convinced her to let doctors run a few more tests.

NOELLE LA CROIX: We're going to admit the dog. We're going to have to keep him in the intensive care unit because he's seizuring.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: My bill so far has been about $500.00, and I'm willing to spend more, $2,000.00 more.

NOELLE LA CROIX: Right.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: But I really don't want him to be an experiment. And I don't want him back unless he's functioning. Use up to $2,000.00 to get this dog on its feet, or...

NOELLE LA CROIX: Or we...?

JANET KIRKPATRICK: Destroy the dog.

NOELLE LA CROIX: OK.

NARRATOR: They begin a series of tests to figure out what's wrong with Jake.

AMY TIDWELL: There are numerous possibilities for the cause of the seizures. One of them might be that the animal had some form of trauma to the head and it resulted in excessive activity within the brain, causing the seizure. An animal could have a virus, such as distemper virus. It might have a neoplasm, which is a form of cancer, which is very unusual in a young animal. But occasionally, there are some tumors that will affect the animal's brain when they are very young. Lead poisoning or low blood glucose could certainly cause an animal to seizure. It's very difficult to give the owners a definitive answer as to what the cause is.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: If they found something that he was born with that they can't reverse and they can't treat, that would be good in the sense that it would be over.

NARRATOR: To see if the seizures are caused by abnormalities in Jake's brain, they will use a CAT scan.

AMY TIDWELL: When we perform a CAT scan on an animal, we have to anesthetize them. Unlike a human, we can't ask them to lie perfectly still, and if they're not still during the scan, then the images will be blurry.

NARRATOR: The CAT scan will give them a series of cross-sectional views of Jake's brain.

RADIOLOGIST: We're going to do parallel slices just like a loaf of bread, and we're going to start at the very back of the skull, and we're going to go all the way up to the eyes.

NARRATOR: As the first images come in, it's clear that Jake is in trouble. One of the fluid-filled chambers of his brain is nearly twice the size it should be.

RADIOLOGIST: We've seen a lot of things in dogs, boy, but I've never seen anything like this.

NOELLE LA CROIX: I had seen the CT scan and I was like, should I tell her? Should I say anything before the doctor comes? Should I say anything? And I saw the look on her face, and I said, "Well, it doesn't look good, and it looks like his brain isn't formed well." (to Janet Kirkpatrick) I kind of feel like I let you down or something.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: No. Well, we gave it another shot. Because I was a little bit impulsive Saturday because I was distraught. So, it wouldn't have been a mistake to put him down, but I would never have known if I had made the right decision. But now, right.

AMY TIDWELL: What we're finding is a very large cyst on the right side of the dog's brain. Basically, the cyst is full of water, so it's like having a large sac that's compressing the normal tissue, and that's what's causing the seizuring. If this were a person, there would be attempts made at draining it. But in a dog, we haven't had very good success with things like this, and I think the prognosis would be fairly poor.

TECH: We only have a couple more slices.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: I want you to put him down.

DR. JOHN MCDONNELL: We'll put him to sleep humanely, all right? And simply what that is, is we give him an overdose of a barbiturate. It's the same that they do to anesthetize them, but it's an overdose.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: Just so long as he doesn't wake up. I want this to end.

DR. JOHN MCDONNELL: He is not going to wake up. He's not going to wake up.

JANET KIRKPATRICK: All right. Because...(weeping)...thank you.

DR. JOHN MCDONNELL: You bet. I'll walk you out.

NOELLE LA CROIX: (to Jake) You were very good to our owner. You gave her a month of happiness, she told me. You gave her a week of really good times. She was so happy. She said that you protected her house. You were very brave, and you gave her so much joy. You did the best you could do. It's the best thing. It's the best thing for him. He had his time. He had his good time in his life, so...

NARRATOR: Vip is a 450-pound African lowland gorilla. He lives with his girlfriend, Gigi, at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston. But there's a problem.

HAYLEY WESTON: Gigi really didn't like him at first. He's a very touchy gorilla. He likes to hug and be really close, and she's not that way. Vip is a genetically valuable male, and he's not breeding here, so we need to get him someplace where he's reproducing.

NARRATOR: But before they can send Vip to another zoo, they have to get close enough to give him a complete physical exam, and make sure he is fertile.

HAYLEY WESTON: All right, we're ready?

MARTHA SMITH: Yeah.

HAYLEY WESTON: Everybody got everything?

MARTHA SMITH: Yeah.

HAYLEY WESTON: So, we'll be TB testing him, doing an ophthalmic exam, dental exam, heart exam. We'll be doing a reproductive exam, x-rays of his wrists, basically everything we can while we have him under anesthesia.

NARRATOR: Tufts veterinary student Martha Smith is considering a career as a zoo vet, and so she's helping out here.

MARTHA SMITH: I'm very excited. This is quite an opportunity to be able to participate in something like this.

HAYLEY WESTON: These are blow darts. They're specially made for zoo animals. It's a two-chamber system, and it comes with a special needle, so that when the syringe hits the animal, it pulls the sleeve back over the needle, and this pressure injects the drug into him. So, I actually put this in a pipe and I blow it with my breath into either his arms or legs, into his muscle. And that's how we dart him. Is he ready? OK.

NARRATOR: At 6:00 a.m., they begin the tricky job of anesthetizing Vip. But Vip senses that something is up.

HAYLEY WESTON: He likes just about all the keepers, but I don't think he likes me too much. But that's because he knows I'm the doctor here. He will probably throw some feces at us and scream and do everything that gorillas do when they're apprehensive. That hit! It's hard to not react when you're getting gorilla feces shot in your face. (laughter) (to Vip) I'm sorry. I know. If I got too close, he could either grab my blow pipe, or he could grab me. You know, I've got to keep in my mind all the time where my body is in relation to him, because once a gorilla grabs you, you can't get loose. Looks good. It went off. I really worry about if he's going to wake up during the procedure. I have a lot of people here. So, if he wakes up and goes berserk or whatever, are we going to be able to control and keep everybody safe, plus him safe at the same time?

VETERINARIAN: We do have to assist his breathing because he's so big that he can't take a big enough breath on his own to fully expand his lungs. And literally, the life of the gorilla right now is in my hands, not in everybody else's.

NARRATOR: To avoid the danger of pulmonary problems and nerve damage, they can only keep Vip under for an hour. Everything has to go like clockwork. A dozen specialists are on hand, doing everything from dental work to a heart exam, with a state-of-the-art sonic probe inserted down the esophagus.

HAYLEY WESTON: And what it does is it enables them to get closer to the heart than they would normally be able to get through the chest wall. So, we're getting a really clear view of the heart and the vessels that go to and from the heart, and how the blood's flowing and all the valves, things that you would have a difficult time on an animal this big seeing if you just went through the chest wall.

NORM ATCHUE: And there's the main pulmonary artery with the pulmonary valve. It looks like an adult human's, no difference.

HAYLEY WESTON: This is something that not many zoos are able to do because the equipment is so expensive, and you're putting a $6,000.00 camera through a gorilla's teeth. So, it makes you a little nervous. If they should bite it, that's gone. That equipment's gone.

NARRATOR: Martha has give minutes to find a vein in Vip's arm and draw enough blood for tests.

MARTHA SMITH: I got a flashback. I'm advancing the catheter. Yeah, I'm in.

NORM ATCHUE: All right. Did you syringe the—

MARTHA SMITH: Do I flush first?

NORM ATCHUE: No.

MARTHA SMITH: No, draw?

NORM ATCHUE: Draw some out first.

MARTHA SMITH: Drawing blood from a gorilla is very different from drawing it from a cat or a dog. I wonder if it's not more similar to drawing it from a person. I don't know. I've never done that.

HAYLEY WESTON: Our reproductive physiologist is going to do a reproductive exam, try and get semen from him, make sure everything's normal. He's collecting semen and he's getting good samples so that we can test him and make sure everything's OK. We can freeze the semen so if we need to use it later, if something should happen to Vip, we have his semen. We can do whatever we need to do with that. How are we? OK. And then, we'll get the x-rays and we're out of here.

NARRATOR: Vip gets a clean bill of health: good heart, no arthritis. And he's fertile. All systems are go for his move to Seattle.

JEANNINE JACKLE: Oh, he would never let you get anywhere near this close to him. He's pretty good.

NARRATOR: But losing Vip will be bittersweet for Jeannine Jackle, who has cared for him for the last six and a half years.

JEANNINE JACKLE: It's hard for us when they go someplace else. But we feel it will be best for him to be in a situation where he'll be with more females, females that might like him better, where he can hopefully reproduce, because that's the important thing, is to get more gorillas.

HAYLEY WESTON: The keepers are all going to miss him. And we'll all miss him. He's got a great personality. But we know it's for his good and the good of the species to go.

NARRATOR: But Vip didn't quite see it that way, and he let it be known that night on the 6 o'clock news.

ANCHORWOMAN: Vip was a little noisy on the trip from Boston to Cincinnati. Then, it was on to Salt Lake City, and that trip was fine. But on the final leg to Seattle, Vip was booted off the plane because he was causing quite a stir. So, he made the 16-hour journey by truck to the Woodland Zoo.

NARRATOR: The female gorillas at Seattle's zoo seem quite taken with Vip. Only time will tell if the romance will be fruitful, though. In December, more than halfway through their last year of school, students face one of the most dreaded of all fourth-year experiences: the veterinary board exams.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: It's a pretty important test, because you won't be able to practice if you don't pass it. And I need to practice as soon as possible to pay back my loans. I have the whole thing planned out.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do. I'm not going to learn it tonight.

NARRATOR: The class has chartered a bus—nicknamed the "stress bus"—for the seven-hour ride to the national exam in Philadelphia. Here, they will be tested on every animal, every disease, and every technique that veterinarians have to know.

SUE COTTER: Veterinarians are unique in having to know about many different species, whereas physicians essentially have to know a lot about one. The way I think we survive and can function with that is that there are fortunately more similarities than there are differences between species. And the way we try to approach with students is have them learn the rule and then, as they go along, maybe learn the exceptions.

NARRATOR: After two grueling days, the ordeal is over.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: I choose EEG instead of EKG.

VETERINARY STUDENT: I did too! Oh, did you do that, too?

MARTHA SMITH: It didn't hit me until a couple of days before we were coming down for the exam. But it was like a shifting of gears. Now, we're thinking about outside of school. We've been cocooned in school for so long and all of a sudden, wait a minute. This isn't about being in school. This is about getting a job. This is about real life. So, it's kind of been an interesting wake-up call.

NARRATOR: The results of the exam won't be in for some time. So, for now, it's back to the hospital to meet a pit bull with an attitude problem. Lucy is not sick, and she's not injured. But she is out of control. And her owners are worried, because they're about to have a baby. If they can't get rid of Lucy's aggression, they might have to get rid of Lucy. So, they've brought her to pet psychiatrist Nick Dodman, who is being assisted by Rosario.

NICHOLAS DODMAN: Hi, I'd like to introduce you to Rosario, one of our senior students.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Hi.

ELIZABETH PORTO: I'm Elizabeth Porto.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: I'm Rosario. How old is she?

ELIZABETH PORTO: We're not really sure.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Where did you get her from?

ELIZABETH PORTO: My parents found her in Pennsylvania, and they kept her for a few months. But they couldn't handle her, and she was very aggressive then. She would growl, like, whenever you wanted to make her do anything she didn't want to do.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Did she ever bite anybody?

ELIZABETH PORTO: She never bit them, but she's bitten me.

NARRATOR: Lucy's owners have been to trainer after trainer, and have started to gain the upper hand. Whenever Lucy wants something, she has to work for it, from walks to daily meals. But they're still afraid of how Lucy might react when the baby comes.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: I just have to ask—I don't even know if this is appropriate, but I'm going to ask anyway.

ELIZABETH PORTO: It's OK. Please ask.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: How come you thought of really training her, and you didn't think of just—because of the danger. I'm scared of dogs that are aggressive. I've been bitten. Why didn't you think of just—

ELIZABETH PORTO: Putting her to sleep?

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: Yeah.

ELIZABETH PORTO: We have. But that is a real issue for this dog, that she might have to be put to sleep. But now, we're attached to her.

MICHAEL PORTO: Besides, we really like the dog.

ELIZABETH PORTO: Do you feel that with our very vigilant supervision after the baby is born that this dog will be able to be a dog that we can co-exist with, with a small child, an infant?

NICHOLAS DODMAN: If you want to try working with me, we could lubricate the works with medicine, which would be along the lines of, you know, a Prozac-like drug—not to make the dog, you know, wonderful at cocktail parties and smile all the time. This is actually to increase serotonin in the brain and therefore to stabilize the dog's mood and reduce aggressiveness, which that always does.

MICHAEL PORTO: Humph.

ELIZABETH PORTO: It's a complicated issue. I don't know. I wouldn't want to have to be on Prozac.

MICHAEL PORTO: Well, I don't have a serious problem with it, especially if it was very temporary.

ELIZABETH PORTO: And especially if it meant the difference between keeping her or putting her to sleep. Yeah.

MICHAEL PORTO: Yeah.

NICHOLAS DODMAN: Behavior problems are probably the leading cause of mortality in the canine population. We estimate something like one and a half million dogs are needlessly put to sleep each year as a result of behavior problems, which is three times as many as die of cancer.

MICHAEL PORTO: The decision to put her on Prozac is a last resort.

ELIZABETH PORTO: And the reason we did it was aggression towards other dogs. That's what we hoped the Prozac would do—would alleviate. And it has taken the edge off it. The other concern was that she would see the baby as a prey animal. And that still remains to be seen.

MICHAEL PORTO: That she would attack it, and that's what we were afraid of.

ELIZABETH PORTO: Well that, we'll still have to be careful with.

MICHAEL PORTO: Yeah.

ELIZABETH PORTO: Lucy. Stay.

NARRATOR: Dr. Dodman also recommended daily doses of something else—(baby crying sounds on tape)—getting Lucy used to the sounds that will be filling the house in less than two weeks.

ELIZABETH PORTO: (To Lucy) Come on. Sit. Down.

NARRATOR: Of all the specialties students are exposed to in their final year, the month spent working in the countryside around Woodstock, Connecticut is probably the most popular. Leaving the hospital behind them, students learn about the most traditional role of their profession: the farm vet. Today, they will have to give a herd of 120 dairy cows three different vaccinations.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: They're all like, heifers, which means that they're teenagers. (laughter)

MIKE THIBODEAU: I think I'm getting the hang of this. So, a lot of my friends now that are out working are all engineers and making very good money. I can just hear it when I talk with them sometimes, you know, just, "Why didn't you go into human medicine?" You know, "You're not going to make any money," this and that. And when I start telling them stories, there is more of—sort of like a giggle, a laugh, you know. Even myself, my first couple of years, too, I never thought of a veterinarian as the same level as a doctor. It was always just, you know, bring my dog in for shots, that sort of thing. And my perception has definitely changed in the time that I've been here.

ENDA CURRID: And you realize early on that you're not going to make a lot of money. But I think the job satisfaction is so high that it becomes less of a problem.

SUE COTTER: One of the things I like about teaching veterinary students is that most of them are here because they're idealistic, they're enthusiastic. They tend to be intelligent. They tend to be good students just because it's so competitive to get in. But even more than that, they're here because this is really what they want to do.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: It can be a difficult career if you're a woman, and you're 5'3" and 115 pounds. You come here and you're like, on your feet, always moving, running if you have to. So, it's tiring. But it's fun.

NARRATOR: Final year rotations influence students' career choices. Rosario's experience on the farm has made her think about specializing in cattle. But first, there is the question of the board exams.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: I don't know. If I don't pass, I'm going to be very sad. Oh, my God—all right. Oh, my God, I did pass them!

MARTHA SMITH: And the winner is—"Dear Candidate—pleased to congratulate you." The winner is a winner. Very good.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: You want to see it? (laughter) I passed! I'm a doctor! That's it. It's legal.

NARRATOR: Today, at the end of fourth year, the students are officially doctors of veterinary medicine. About a third of the class will go on to further training. But with debts reaching $100,000.00, the others will need to start practicing immediately.

MARTHA'S MOTHER: I'm so proud of you.

MARTHA SMITH: I've been working my whole life for this.

MARTHA'S MOTHER: Congratulations, Doctor.

MARTHA SMITH: Thank you.

NARRATOR: Martha and her classmates have become animal doctors. But they are not the only ones whose lives have been changed by the trials of the last 12 months. Vip has two new girlfriends at the Seattle Zoo: Jumoke and Amanda. Both are pregnant, and two baby gorillas are due any day. Mike's dummy foal has made a complete recovery. She seems like a good prospect for the track. Schatzie's hip is on the mend, and she'll be playing Frisbee again soon. Wilbur the pig is still stubborn and spoiled. It seems like you can't teach an old pig new tricks, after all. Thanks to Prozac, Lucy the pit bull has mellowed, and considers the baby as part of the pack. Lucy's owners are hoping she won't change her mind when the baby begins to walk.

ROSARIO DELGADO-LECAROZ: I'm so excited. I'm very excited. I got all the goals achieved, so I passed my boards, I graduated. My friends are here, my family is here. Everything worked out very well. I'm very excited.

MIKE THIBODEAU: Eight years I've been hiding in school, you know? (laughter) And then, as of tomorrow, they're sending us out into the world.

MARVELYN MOTAMED: I'm going to find a job! (laughter) That's what I'm going to do.

MIKE THIBODEAU: It's over!

NARRATOR: Tonight on NOVA, a mystery on the icy depths of Loch Ness.

__: We saw this black hump, come out of the water.

__: About 30 feet in length.

NARRATOR: Eye witnesses bring the legend of Loch Ness to life. Can science bring proof to the surface? Is Nessie a prehistoric monster or an elaborate hoax? An expedition launches a search for the answer. The beast of Loch Ness. ...("NOVA" theme music)... Major funding for NOVA is provided by the Park Foundation, dedicated to education and quality television.

NARRATOR: In the remote highlands of other Scotland, there is a place of haunting beauty. Steeped in mystery. Loch Ness. Beneath this wind-swept surface, lies one of the world's deepest bodies of water. It is a cold and forbidding environment. Drowning victims sink without a trace in the icy depths. Divers fear becoming disoriented in the eternal night, ever mindful of the legend of Loch Ness.

Many centuries ago, the people of these hills believes that a beast roamed these waters. In this century, thousands of sightings have brought the legend to life.

__: I'm driving along the Loch site, glancing out of the window, and I saw this, as I say, described to me like this boiling in the water. And I looked up at the Loch, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw this black hump came out of the water.

__: About 30 feet in length, and nearly ten feet in height from the water to the top of the back.

__: It seemed as it had been still and started to move off. But there was a neck.

__: And it flipped over, just flipped over like that, crashed down, and you could see it.

__: There's the chance I've seen something in the water, but what is it?

NARRATOR: Is this what they are seeing? A photograph taking in 1934 shows an unknown animal, or an elaborate hoax. This film was shot by an aeronautical engineer in 1960. When computer processed for NOVA, it shoes a featureless back hump, quite different from the boat, filmed later that day for comparison. Both are moving at ten miles an hour. Photographic experts at the Royal Air Force concluded that the hump is at least six feet wide and five feet high. Probably an animate object.

Is there something here? Many have tried to solve the mystery without success. But the quest continues.

__: Okay, let's go. ...(music)...

NARRATOR: Today, a new expeditions arrives to search the Loch. The leader is Bob Rines. Rines is a man of many accomplishments: A respected patent attorney and founder of a law school, he was trained in science and engineering at MIT, and helped in them development of both radar and sonar. But his true passion is a pursuit few scientists take seriously: The hunt for the Loch Ness Monster.

RINES: If you don't have an open mind, in my judgment, you're not a scientist. If you don't have ideas, if you don't have adventure, if you don't have an open mind, you'll never make a discovery. And I think there's a misconception that science has to be something rigid, something sponsored by NASA or the government, or millions of dollars. A scientist is a scientist; I don't care where you put him.

NARRATOR: Rines' longtime partner in the search is Charles Wyckoff. A photographic innovator with over 60 patents to his name, Wyckoff created the film stocks that captured the first images of atomic bomb explosions and moon landings. It took time for this scientist to warm to the idea of the Monster.

WYCKOFF: At first, I thought it was myth, and then I became an agnostic. And then, pretty soon, I said, "Gee, you know, there's more to it than that. I guess there's something down there." And I got really intrigued. And the more instrumentation I cooked up, the more intrigued I became.

NARRATOR: For these two men, this expedition might well be the final chapter in a quest that began some 30 years ago, when Rines became intrigued by the mystery on a chance visit to Loch Ness.

RINES: We can still do it, can't we?

__: ...(inaudible) ...(music)...

NARRATOR: As a lawyer, used to dealing with eye-witness testimony, he found the accounts of sightings persuasive.

RINES: I just got this strong feeling everybody was not lying. Everybody wasn't a fool, that there was something there.

NARRATOR: His hunch turned to conviction in the summer of 1972, when he and his wife, Carol, had an experience that would ever haunt them.

RINES: We came out on the field and looked down, and there was this big, grayish hump. It went out against the wind currents into the ...(inaudible) Bay, it turned around and came back right in front of us, and sank.

NARRATOR: The sighting inspired Rines to mount an expedition, combining old technologies in new ways. He aimed a sonar out into the depths and nearby, placed a camera with a strobe light to take pictures every 45 seconds. After weeks of waiting, the plan finally paid off.

RINES: Early in that morning, about one o'clock, we began to see the salmon jumping all over this bay. The rivers were dry so they couldn't go up to spawn. And we could see it on the sonar, too, you'd see fish moving, and then a big target came in on the sonar, and were praying that we were just the right distance that the edge of the camera could pick up something if we were lucky.

NARRATOR: For thousands of frames, there was nothing. Then, suddenly, three frames showing an object reflecting the strobe light back at the camera. After computer enhancement at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the image revealed a flipper-like shape some six feet long.

RINES: We got at least three frames, corroborated by similar images on the sonar target. That was a thrill.

NARRATOR: Rines' excitement was shared by his mentor, Harold "Doc" Edgerton, a legendary figure at MIT, the inventor of both strobe photography and side-scan sonar. Edgerton would be an active participant in Rines' later expeditions. New sonar hits and this image, in which some see the body and neck of a large animal helped to win an other important convert, one of Britain's most respected naturalists, Sir Peter Scott.

SCOTT: What is a body of evidence, which I am prepared to accept, which cannot be explained in terms of known phenomena.

NARRATOR: With the support of Edgerton and Scott, the idea of the Monster gained new credibility. In 1975, Rines and Scott were invited to write an article in the prestigious scientific journal, Nature.

They were also given the chance to present their findings in a highly charged hearing in the House of Commons.

RINES: Our sole objective, to get the zoological community all over the world, wherever there are other scientists, to analyze what we have produced, and, indeed, to debate what these things may be, and to get sufficiently interested, that scientists dare to come to Loch Ness.

NARRATOR: For a moment, Rines had the attention of the scientific world. But his case for Nessie was soon embroiled in controversy. The flipper photo, already computer-enhanced by NASA, somehow became this image, raising doubts about its validity.

Even more controversial was Peter Scott's bold conclusion, based on the eye-witness sightings, and the shape of the flipper, that Nessie was a Plesiasaur, (?) a pre-historic aquatic reptile, believed to have died out some 65 million years ago. Zoologists at the British Natural History Museum ridiculed the idea.

__: It seems to me that we've been invited to accept that in a relatively small body of water, in what is from the zoological viewpoint, one of the best explored countries in the world, we have a population of large predatory reptiles which could be warm-blooded, and which might even be carnivals with snorkels. Now, this, I find very difficult to take.

__: We shall shy a little bit of the Loch. One of my predecessors at the museum was actually sacked from his job for going up on the Loch, and probably the monster here has had a very bad effect on science in that many scientists had a nervous twitch when the Loch was mentioned, for reasons you'll quite understand; it could be the kiss of death to your career.

__: I think they got frightened. Those who make their living from this, the zoologists, are not ready to believe, on the basis of one picture, that something that should have been dead 65 million years ago is still existing in some form at Loch Ness, Scotland. ...(bag pipes)...

NARRATOR: As the years passed, with no follow-up by zoologists, Rines felt growing pressure to settle unfinished business. With only Wyckoff left of the original team, it is now or never.

RINES: Recently Charlie and I looked at each other. As a matter of fact, on his 80th birthday. He says, "Oh my God, Edgerton is dead, Sir Peter Scott is gone, Carol Rines is gone, and here we still are." And I said, "I think we owe it to them to go back with improved technology and try to duplicate the experiments where we were successful before, just to see if there's still something left in that Loch. And if there is, to have a bag of tricks to do much better to try to photograph it.

NARRATOR: But searching Loch Ness is harder than it looks. Stretching 24 miles from the Cross-Scotland Caladonian Canal to Inverness, where the river Ness empties out into the sea, the Loch fills a deep chasm with sheer walls that plunge 800 feet down, making it the largest body of water in the British Isles.

To search this vast expanse, Rines has assembled a team of volunteers from the world of science and engineering. The sonar experts, oceanographer John Fish, and marine biologist Arnie Carr, are partners in American underwater search and survey, one of the leading sonar companies in the world.

__: I specialize, and my partner specializes in locating hard-to-find underwater targets. So I just view this as another opportunity to look in a body of water we haven't been in before.

NARRATOR: High above the Loch, Fish and his assistant install a relay station for their global positioning system, a key tool in Rines' new, more aggressive search strategy. Instead of waiting for the Monster to come to him, this time, Rines will sweep the Loch with sonar. If the sonar team finds a target, the GPS will give them a precise location. The camera team, close behind in a second boat, will then move in and attempt to capture the target on film.

WYCKOFF: I made a slight change in the camera, so we'd better make sure this thing is going to fit alright.

NARRATOR: Getting pictures will take all of Wyckoff's ingenuity.

WYCKOFF: You got the frame?

NARRATOR: Loch Ness is filled with peat particles washed down from the surrounding hills. The yellow haze limits visibility to a few feet.

WYCKOFF: It's like driving down the road at night in a fog. Your headlights create this fog and you can't see the road. Now if we could separate the headlights off to the side, you'd have a better chance; you'd see the road. So I'm doing the same thing here. I'm separating the light source from the camera.

NARRATOR: With most of the expedition's limited funds devoted to sonar, Wyckoff and his colleague, Sheldon Apsol, (?) have had to improvise. In the best MIT tradition, they have assembled a rig with a low light video camera and car headlight mounted on an aluminum frame left over from an expedition in the '70s.

WYCKOFF: We don't own very much of the equipment. We're known as "scroungers." And most of us are MIT, and that's a natural thing at MIT. ...(laughter)

__: So all this stuff that looks like it came out of somebody's garage actually works?

WYCKOFF: It actually works, yeah. It worked 20 years ago; it will work now.

NARRATOR: The final team member will play a very different role.

RINES: Hey, hi Adrian.

SHINE: It's been a long time. What are you up to?

NARRATOR: Local naturalist, Adrian Shine, came to the Loch 20 years ago in the hope of solving the mystery. But his research has convinced him that there's no monster here.

SHINE: You don't give up, do you?

RINES: Never give up, never give up.

NARRATOR: Despite their strongly opposing views, Rines has asked Shine to lend his expertise to the expedition.

SHINE: I've been granted an input to this expedition, as a sort of resident skeptic. And it's a role that I am actually fulfilling to what extent I can.

NARRATOR: With the preparations completed, Rines, anxious to get started, briefs the team.

RINES: Now, the time has come for us to get going. We've only got five days with all the equipment, for purposed we basically came here for. We've got to scour this lake.

NARRATOR: A quarter of a century after his first attempt, Rines is back in the hunt.

RINES: ...(inaudible) would call me every couple of months, when are you going to give up what you're doing, you're crazy, practice law, do something worthwhile. I identify with what these big things are that shouldn't be there in Loch Ness. I just didn't listen. Now, I'm listening, I hope it's not too late.

NARRATOR: The lead boat is packed with high tech gear. Attached to the hull is a fish-finding sonar pointing straight down from surface to bottom. It will supplement the expedition's primary search tool, Sidescan Sonar. While it looks like Edgerton's original device, today's model is far more sophisticated. Pulled below and behind the boat, the Sidescan tow fish (?) sends out a sound impulse or "ping" in a 180 degree arc.

Sound waves traveling through the water reflect of objects in their path. Signals arriving back at the tow fish are sent up the cable to instruments on the boat, which gradually build up an image of the underwater environment. Any unusual mark on the printout will alert the operator to a potential target.

As the sonar team begins its search, the mood is optimistic. In a lake where the largest known fish is a salmon, reports of moving sonar targets, up to fifteen feet long, have persisted over the last ten years.

The most ambitious search ever made of Loch Ness was Operation Deep Scan in 1987. A flotilla of boats mounted with fish-finding sonar, spend a week sweeping the Loch. Most of the targets they encountered had a logical explanation, but not all. Expedition leader, Adrian Shine.

SHINE: Three contacts we still can't explain, but that does not mean we never will explain them. :

NARRATOR: In 1994 the British Natural History Museum took part in Project Urchin, the first major effort to study the ecology of the Loch. Monsters were not on the agenda. Yet its sonar experts said they too found large moving targets.

__: It's hard to say exactly what it was, but for at least seven, eight, nine minutes, but it's very difficult to say exactly waht it was.

__: They did find all sorts of interesting sonar targets, including moving targets. We have no idea what they were.

NARRATOR: Well Rines' systematic sonar sweep is going smoothly, Wyckoff is rediscovering the difficulty of taking pictures in Loch Ness. Moisture has seeped in and ruined the camera. They will have to send for a replacement; the timing couldn't be worse.

Aboard the sonar board, the fish finder has picked up a large target.

__: Very big echoes here on the surface.

__: ...(inaudible)

__: They're not that deep, they're only about, what, 20 meters down.

__: We haven't seen anything like that before.

__: No, I've never seen it quite as big as that before.

__: The side scan (?) might pick that up. If it's not directly over it.

NARRATOR: If the side scan picks up the target, it may reveal more. But interpretation can be difficult. With sound waves bouncing off the steep sides, the Loch is notorious for generating misleading sonar images. Even changes in the water temperature or thermal can create apparent targets where none exist.

__: That target should have been here by now. I see ...(inaudible) returns. I don't see anything in the water though.

__: Could it be our beam is too low?

__: I think it is. We may not have gone over it yet. It may be right there, but I think our fish is too low in the water. It's much closer to the bottom. The target we're seeing on the sonar was high.

NARRATOR: Whatever the target was, the tow fish passed beneath it and failed to pick it up.

__: And range to the camera, we have a whopping big target on Gordon's sonar, but unfortunately non on the side scan because—

NARRATOR: Still, it's a tantalizing start. Even Arnie Carr is beginning to believe there may be something here.

CARR: I think there's a phenomenon here or something that is really interesting, really, I would like to get an answer to. And we had a target today. It didn't look like a thermal to me; it looked more biological, but I don't know what it was.

NARRATOR: For Rines, this unconfirmed hit is an encouraging sign. Could the creature he and thousands of others believe they have witnessed still be here? ...(music)... The sightings began when a new road gave travellers their first good views of Loch Ness. It was here in 1933 that two local residents reported seeing an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface. An account of their sighting in the local paper brought the news of the beast to the rest of the world. The Loch Ness Monster has been a media phenomenon ever since.

__: Loch Ness, on which the eyes of the world are focused, the reported haunt for previous direct monster or monsters, and the newly-founded venture ground of modern Gullivers.

NARRATOR: The Intrepid, armed to the teeth, set out to capture the beast, to no avail. Capture an image proved to be the next best thing. Some photographers resorted to outright fraud. Others succumbed to the Loch's powers of deception. Boat weights (?), wild life, and floating debris have all been mistaken for monsters. But one photograph stood above the rest. ...(music)....

Taken in 1934, and attributed to a reputable London surgeon, Dr. R. Kenneth Wilson, it seemed to show an unidentified animal surfacing at Loch Ness. For 60 years, it was the definitive image of Nessie. Until 1994, when a story broke claiming this classic photo was actually an elaborate hoax. The man responsible for the story was Alastair Boyd, a Nessie believer. In 1979, Boyd saw what appeared to be a huge animal in Loch Ness. That experience made him question the surgeon's photograph.

BOYD: I was suspicious of a hoax, actually, to begin with, because I'd always felt that firstly, the water texture in the surgeon's photo indicates to me that we're looking at a small object, probably no more than a foot high, and these are ripples, rather than waves.

NARRATOR: Boyd's investigation led to man named Christian Sperling, who claimed that he and the surgeon, Dr. Wilson, had been part of a plot to dupe a London newspaper. The object in the photograph was a one-foot plastic neck that Sperling had grafted to a toy submarine. This confession dealt a powerful blow to the Loch Ness Monster.

SMITH: We don't know exactly where Wilson was when he took this photograph, or claimed to take the photograph, but he—

NARRATOR: But to American journalist, Richard Smith, the confession didn't ring true. With Rines' support, Smith has come to Loch Ness to find out if the hoax story may, itself, be a hoax.

__: It's extremely important to the Academy, to us, to the public, to know, is the photograph possibly real, is the photograph possibly a hoax.

SMITH: My research has shown that the circumstances, as best we know, surrounding the Wilson photo, are consistent with Wilson's stories. I think that I'm willing to go out on a limb, as it were, and do this investigation. I think it's certainly worthwhile, no matter what the outcome is.

NARRATOR: Is this a one-foot model, photographed from up close, or the four-foot neck of a living animal, shot from a distance? To find out, Smith has built floating necks, one and four feet high. His plan is to photograph them from different vantage points to see which one matches the original photo.

SMITH: We're going to be two miles this side of ...(inaudible).

NARRATOR: Smith's experiment is possible only because the discovery of a new version of the surgeon's photo.

SMITH: One thing that's absolutely crucial to understand is that the familiar Nessie image, the familiar surgeon's photograph, is actually a cropped detail of a central portion of a much wider view.

NARRATOR: The narrow strip of the far shore line, and the absence of near shoreline show how the picture was framed. And the ripples around the object provide another clue.

SMITH: The circular disturbance is also very interesting, because it's being used to calculate the angle at which the picture was taken, assuming that that's a round disturbance in the water, but of course, we don't see it round because we're at an angle, it turns into an ellipse.

NARRATOR: Analysis of the ellipse shows that the camera was pointing at an angle of 19 degrees down from the horizon.

SMITH: Has this area changed a lot? Has the terrain different now?

NARRATOR: Using these clues to guide his experiment, Smith has recruited a surveyor and a professional photographer to help him duplicate the surgeon's photo.

__: And put on the ranger finder, there we are.

__: Nineteen degrees.

__: Excellent, let's see what we've got. And that's very close, I think it's dead on to the original scene.

__: Move it a little bit to this direction.

NARRATOR: Down on the shoreline where Sperling said the photograph was taken, Smith tests the "one-foot" model.

SMITH: Is this matching the original photograph at all?

__: Yeah, the scale of the object is right, but it's far too far away.

SMITH: So higher up in the picture?

__: Yeah.

SMITH: So it seems like the problem is that when we get this thing more positioned that it's actually in the photograph, it becomes too big.

__: ...(inaudible)

SMITH: And this is the four-foot high target that's at, as I recall, this is at the three-foot elevation.

NARRATOR: The next morning, the team get their first look at the prints. To Rines and Wyckoff, the one-foot model doesn't match the original photo. The four-foot model is more convincing.

__: These closer, more like the four-foot model, but I don't know why. (?)

SMITH: I think I may have a reason for that, which is, when you put together the basic elements, the kind of camera Wilson claimed to have used, the kind of position where he believed he was, and a target of about the size he reported, you come up with a photograph that he claimed to have taken. This is certainly, although not proof, it is, I think, some very compelling evidence that perhaps, the original testimony of Lt. Col. R. Kenneth Wilson was genuine.

NARRATOR: Smith is convinced; now it's up to the doubters.

__: It could be very possible that they could come up with a photographic experiment in which their picture will look a lot more like this. And I hope that will happen, but it needs to be done. ...(music)...

NARRATOR: A short way down the Loch, Alastair Boyd decided to take up Smith's challenge, with the ever skeptical Shine lending a helping hand.

__: This looks about ideal, doesn't it?

NARRATOR: With the one-foot styrofoam model, they hope to prove the photo was a hoax. They too are careful to angle their camera at 19 degrees.

__: Okay, just coming into frame, just back off slightly. That's good.

NARRATOR: On the left is the recreation. On the right is the original. Despite the near identical images, Smith has reservations.

SMITH: See, now, this is a very interesting experiment, and you know, you're getting something which is certainly very close. One problem that I've always had, and it's certainly very much demonstrated by this is the ripple patterns around the object.

__: You can't reproduce them.

SMITH: I don't see them in the photographs.

BOYD: We're not getting ripple patterns.

NARRATOR: Boyd's experiment shows that a one-foot model can produce an image much like the surgeon's photo. The picture might be a hoax, but Boyd has no doubt that the creature in the Loch is real.

BOYD: I know that the thing I saw was not a log or an otter or a wave or anything like that. It was a large animal, it came heaving out of the water, something like a whale. I mean the part that was actually on the surface when it stopped rolling through was at least 20 feet long. It was totally extraordinary. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. And if I could afford to spend the rest of my life up here looking for another glimpse of it, I would. ..(music)...

NARRATOR: Day three of the expedition. With the camera still out of commission, Wyckoff has joined Rines aboard the sonar boat for a night run.

WYCKOFF: I just hope we get something in light. Because I almost feel in my bones that something is going to happen.

RINES: You feel it, I feel it too.

WYCKOFF: That's where we'll get it if we get it.

NARRATOR: Tonight they will concentrate on Urchin Bay, where the ruins of a fourteenth century castle overlook the deepest part of the Loch.

RINES:And of ceruse, this is the time, this is the circumstances in which the academy has had luck, back in 1972, and I think things are coming in.

NARRATOR: After several hours of routine searching, there is a flurry of activity.

__: We've got a target. ...(simultaneous conversation)....

NARRATOR: A number of targets have appeared on the print-out. One catches Arnie Carr's attention. He estimates that it's five meters, or sixteen feet long.

CARR: One-eighty to port, and do a reciprocal of what you've already done.

NARRATOR: Using the GPS relay system, they come about to search the same area again. If the target is still there on the second pass, it's probably stationary debris. If not, it's moving.

__: Gentlemen, we may just ...(inaudible) and what we expected to do is we get a quick reciprocal to come back over that target with the sonar, and we couldn't see it, it was gone. And so we saw it one time, went over the same area, didn't see it again. It's moving. ...(music)_...

NARRATOR: To marine biologist Arnie Carr, the size and density of the mark on the print-out indicate a large, solid mass, very different from a school of fish.

CARR: It's an unusual target, especially the density. I mean a moving target we've had before, but one with such a density we haven't had. Well, if you get into, like, a whale or something like that, yes, you will find something that dense. Some of the whales, obviously, will be larger, but five meters is not small.

NARRATOR: Carr's analysis makes photographic back-up essential. The next morning Wyckoff's team is back in action. They've replaced their video camera with a professional underwater model.

WYCKOFF: This camera is a much more sensitive camera, so we can see father under water, and it will go deeper. The other camera was limited because we had a scuba diver's housing for it. We could only go down, maybe, 150 feet. With this, we can go down to several hundred meters.

__: This definition we're getting is just fantastic.

__: It really is.

NARRATOR: With the new camera performing even better than expected, the expedition is back up to speed. There is a sense of anticipation that the long search is about to pay off with an exciting zoological discovery. ...(music)... If Nessie is an animal, as the eye-witnesses say, the implications extend well beyond Loch Ness. Long necked monsters have been reported in northern lakes all over the world, from Lake Ciarre (?) in Siberia, to Lake Champlain in North America. Could these other lake "monsters" be flesh and blood too?

A small group of investigators believe these creatures might, in fact, be species as yet undiscovered by science. They call themselves cryptozoologists.

__: —Lake Champlain, the descriptions seem to be much more serpentine, slender, longer—

__: Like this one here.

__: Yeah, but not like this.

NARRATOR: Cryptozoology is dedicated to the study of cryptids, or unknown animals. In almost every case, the search is triggered by eye-witness reports, a source of evidence most scientists disregard.

__: Eye-witness evidence is completely useless in science. For science something has to be repeatable. And for repeatability, you have to have a specimen. You talk tan eye witness, you've got no repeatability there. You can't go back in time and check what they saw.

NARRATOR: But eye-witness evidence sometimes leads to remarkable discoveries. The Okapi in 1901; the mountain gorilla in 1912; and in 1994, the pseudo oryx in Vietnam. These were brand new species unknown to science.

RINES: Science somehow has this blind spot. They've got to learn to evaluate eye-witness responses, emotional responses and other things that are very real. That may not be anywhere near 100 percent accuracy, but they deserve to be fit into the total totality of the evidence.

NARRATOR: Rines' conviction is shared by Roy Mackal, a pioneer in the field of cryptozoology. Mackal, a molecular biologist by training, came to Scotland in the 1960s and joined a local group of enthusiasts who kept a constant vigil on the Loch. His work helped persuade Rines that there was something here worth investigating.

MACKAL: I came because I was curious, and all we had, basically were a few still photographs, some of which have since turned out to be frauds. But the eye-witness observations, while at least valid evidence, nevertheless, in some cases, were very compelling.

I wonder if you could sketch the outline of what you saw, just, make a water a line, and then sort of sketch what you saw.

NARRATOR: It's been 30 years since Mackal interviewed eye-witnesses, and the descriptions remain the same. ...(music)... Long before Sir Peter Scott, when the Highland tourist industry made it popular, people were convinced that Nessie was a prehistoric relic.

__: I went into the house, got out my book of prehistoric creatures, and the nearest I could liken it to was a plesiosaur. (?)

NARRATOR: Plesiosaurs were cold-blooded marine reptiles that co-existed with the dinosaurs during the Jurassic and Crutatious periods, feeding on fish in the warm inland seas.

__: They looked like giant turtles with long necks. They swam rather like penguins. If you could imagine a giant penguin with four limbs going up and down, you've got a plesiosaur. As far as we can tell they dies out 17 million years ago.

NARRATOR: But the oceans are home to a variety of prehistoric relics. From the massive megamouth shark, discovered in 1976, to the coelacanth, a fish once thought to have died out at the time as the plesiosaurs.

__: The coelacanth is a very remarkable fish, because it's a form that was thought extinct for 60 to 80 million years. And all of a sudden, it was found alive, the form was found alive in 1938. It proves that if it can happen once, it can happen again.

NARRATOR: Could a small population of plesiosaurs have escaped extinction, taking up refuge in Loch Ness? The Loch's geological origins hold the answer. Loch Ness straddles the Great Glen, a massive geological fault tat nearly cuts Scotland in two. As the land masses on either side of the fault slid by each other, they created and area of shattered rock or breccia. Each time an ice age descended on the northern hemisphere, the glaciers returned, repeatedly carving out this breccia to form a deep basin.

__: As the ice moved down from the tributary valleys on either side of us, it got confined into the valley created along the fault, and it accelerated. And this acceleration deepened the flow of the Loch. So we've got successive major glaciations, and during each one, it gets deeper and deeper and deeper into the fault, along the line of the fault. And then it opens out, the ice opens out at Inverness, and so it ceases to erode down, and so that's why we've got an enclosed basis over 800 feet deep in this locality.

NARRATOR: Plesiosaurs could not have survived in Loch Ness since the age of dinosaurs, because for much of that time, it was a solid block of ice. When the glaciers finally retreated eleven thousand years ago, they left behind a deep pool of frigid water and a shallow passage to the sea: The River Ness. Could Plesiosaurs have used the river to enter the Loch since then? It's an unlikely scenario. Even if they had somehow escaped extinction in the open oceans, these cold blooded reptiles would have had to adapt to the near freezing temperatures of the Loch Ness.

__: After carefully considering all of the evidence, most importantly, sonar contacts which give some idea of how these animals moves and how fast they can swim, this convinced me that we had to have an aquatic mammal.

NARRATOR: Warm blooded mammals have the metabolism to thrive in cold water. And one primitive species of whale had a serpentine neck. It's known as an archeocyte. (?)

__: It's just a long snake-like whale known from the fossil record, thought to be extinct for 18 million years. But clearly some have survived, and this is not a surprise, because we have other animals which were thought to be extinct 70 million years ago, and they're alive and well.

NARRATOR: But can Loch Ness sustain a breeding colony of these animals? ..(music).... Adrian Shine and fish biologist Alan Butterworth have set out this morning to explain the Loch's ecology.

BUTTERWORTH: Loch Ness is a huge body of water, more water in the whole of England and Wales put together. It's very unproductive. There are very, very few chemical nutrients, fertilizers to start the food chain off. And the little microscopic plants have got another problem, as well. There's very little light penetration, and I'm going to just show you here. This is called sucky disk (?) and it goes down and I've got to see where I lose sight of it. So it's going down in the water, you can see how brown the water color is. It's dark about four meters down. Now that's pretty poor.

NARRATOR: The dim light stifles plant growth, and in effects it ripples up the food chain, starting with the tiny plankton that feed on vegetation.

__: Well, we're right in the middle of the Loch, we're in the deepest part of the northern basin and what we're looking at is the food sources that are fit to live out here.

__: I'm pulling up through some 30 meters of water, that's just about down to where the plankton do by day, they migrate downwards by day..

__: Well what's happened, there are not a lot of animals in there. And when you think that that's from three cubic meters of water, there's not a lot there to feed on. So the food supply is very poor.

NARRATOR: Because of this limited food supply, the number of fish living in Loch Ness is surprisingly small for so large a lake. But there's another possibility: Migratory salmon which pass through the Loch on their way to spawn.

__: You'll get quite large numbers passing up close on the shore. And these can be big fish, they can weight up to 20 or 30 pounds. And we can work out, at the most, there will be something like fifteen tons of salmon passing through the loch within a monthly period. That is still not a lot of food to support a population of large predators.

NARRATOR: There is only one other plausible explanation for what Nessie might be: A visitor from the sea.

__: There is one creature, very reptilian in appearance that is actually the largest fish you will ever see in fresh water, where it eats nothing. I think it's possible that the tradition itself was begun by Baltic Sturgeon, making the occasional entrance to the Loch, not finding mates, and then going away again.

NARRATOR: A large sturgeon could pass in and out of the Loch undetected, as could a large eel. Eels have been known to reach ten feet in length in the open ocean. Either one would explain the sonar hits. ...(music)... But the eye-witnesses don't buy it.

Cameron: I, along with a friend, was on the south shore of Loch Ness fishing for brown trout. I saw an object surface that was a large black object, a whale-like object, going from infinity up, from the ground onto a block end.

NARRATOR: Retired Chief of Detectives for Inverness, Ian Cameron, along with seven other people, reported one of the longest sighting on record, lasting almost an hour-.

CAMERON: The nearest thing would be, sort of the back of a ...(inaudible) elephant, if you cut bits off and replaced it.

__: Have you ever gone out on the Loch in a boat?

CAMERON: Not on your life. I wouldn't go out on a small boat on the Loch Ness if you gave me the whole ...(inaudible).

NARRATOR: Day five, the Loch is flat calm, a good day for Nessie-hunting.

RINES: This is the last day with Arnie, and the towing side. After that, we have to do fixed side. (?) So we've got to make the most of the day.

NARRATOR: By now, Rines has complete faith in his battle-tested sonar team. The pressure is on the untried camera crew.

RINES: And you guy got to be ready. The minute we hit that target come. ...(music)...

NARRATOR: For today's last push, Rines has decided to focus, again, on Urchin Bay. Late in the morning, the boat's fish finder records a target at a depth of 25 meters.

__: What have you got?

__: Wow!

__: What is it, about ten meters, twenty meters?

__: It's about twenty-five meters.

__: Twenty-five meters, we might pull that out on the sonar.

__: Well check it.

__: ...(inaudible) Can you get over here with the cameras.

__: We're on our way.

__: I've got two targets in the mid-water area over here, on-board, about 60, 65 meters.

__: Are you folks picking up anything now?

__: We find a couple of targets off your port side, maybe a bout 50 meters.

__: Towards us! As fast as you can, please.

__: The camera flips over if we go too fast.

__: Pull it out and come over, then.

NARRATOR: This is the expedition's biggest challenge, imaging a moving target under water.

__: Three main targets and they spread out.

__: If they moved off in that port side over to the left, they could probably pick it up with a camera. We're getting a mid-water target, here. Eighteen meters or so, the port of us, come as fast as you can.

__: I'm answering a target, I'm answering a target. (?)

__: Look at all those fish.

__: That small number of fish may be tracking larger predators.

__: The small number of fish maybe be followed by some hungry predator.

__: We've seen the small number of fish, but we haven't seen the hungry predator.

NARRATOR: Minutes later, the target is out of range. Just when they seem closest to an answer, the team runs out of time. Wyckoff has learned the hard way that tracking and imaging a moving target in the murky waters of Loch Ness requires resources well beyond the means of this expedition. And something even money can't buy: Luck. But Rines has achieved his primary goal, finding out if there is still something here.

RINES: We certainly weren't arrogant enough to think that we can cover every single spot in this lake and look in there and find a target. But what we did is the most probable things, at least in our judgment. And if we can intrigue, and I think we have intrigued, this new generation to carry on if there's enough excitement here about what we're doing, we will have accomplished a lot.

__: I don't think Bob Rines is crazy. He's obsessed, obviously, but I think the obsession is natural. It's a human instinct. There's something here that needs to be answered, something here that needs to be proven. ..(music)...

NARRATOR: Reports of monsters in Loch Ness demand skepticism, especially given its long history of hoaxes. And the evidence from biology and geology seem to rule out Plesiosaurs or any other large, resident predator. But a lake so deep could well have a few secrets left. Someday, a more plausible explanation may emerge. Perhaps an occasional visitor from the sea. Until then, the unexplained sonar hits and the conviction of the eye-witnesses will keep the legend of Loch Ness alive.

__: It was just big, I think that's the best way to put it. So it certainly wasn't a seal and it certainly wasn't a fish. And all I can say is, looking at the Loch, is that somewhere in there is the Loch Ness Monster, and as far as I'm concerned, I've seen it.

__: Though I remain convinced of the sincerity of many of the eye-witnesses, a majority of sightings are actually boat weights, and all the other hosts of illusion that you can get on Loch Ness, particularly on a calm day.

__: I saw it and I'm not going to be dissuaded. I know, and it wasn't just, you know, an imagination, and I'm a sane guy. I've got no axe to grind. As I say, I sell pet food. What use to me is the Loch Ness Monster?

__: Yeah, I could wake up tomorrow and find that they Loch Ness Monster has just crawled ashore with a large sign saying, "Fooled you again." It wouldn't be the first time scientists have been wrong; we've been wrong before and we're going to be wrong again. And maybe there's something about Loch Ness we don't know after all. ...(laughter)

__: No way am I even attempting to convert anybody to the religion of the object of Loch Ness. But I saw it, and nothing can take that away. ...(music)... (end)

BIRD BRAINS

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Hello, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, your host of NOVA scienceNOW. You know, the ability to speak is one of those things that makes us humans think we're special.

EINSTEIN Parrot): Special.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: But researchers have struggled to figure out exactly how we got this talent.

EINSTEIN: Talent.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Because learning to speak a language takes a lot more than just mindlessly parroting what someone else says.

EINSTEIN: Mindless.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Now, as correspondent Chad Cohen reports, we're finding new clues in the brains of some animals, who have the language ability to even rival our own.

EINSTEIN: Split infinitive!

CHAD COHEN: It's a skill that comes naturally to even the tiniest among us. We take in sounds, repeat them and learn to talk. We're so good at it, we can even do it in more than one language, like these little New Yorkers, who are learning French even before they've mastered English. And yet we still don't understand how.

It's a mystery scientists are starting to unravel by studying a brain about 1,000 times smaller than our own, a brain that's gotten a really bad rap.

If someone calls you a birdbrain how would you feel?

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Oh, a great compliment! The bird brain is a very good brain.

CHAD COHEN: Ofer Tchernichovski, one of the world's leading experts in birdsong, thinks the term "birdbrain" is a real misnomer. In fact he believes the key to solving the mystery of speech lies in the notes of a bird's song.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: By looking at the song and see how the song develop, you can understand, sometimes, very basic principles of how our brain works and how our mind works.

CHAD COHEN: In his lab, Ofer studies an Australian songbird called a zebra finch.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Now you can actually see them side by side.

CHAD COHEN: It turns out, this tiny bird learns to sing much like we learn to speak.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: In the beginning, the bird will start singing a very faint, unstructured song, similar to babbling in human infants.

CHAD COHEN: It then starts to mimic the sounds it hears from the adults around it, a lot like we do.

MOM Can you say ham? See the ham?

BABY: Ham.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: So birds are vocal learners, and vocal learning is very rare in nature.

CHAD COHEN: While zebra finches learn only one song, other songbirds, like canaries, can learn new songs seasonally. Some hummingbirds learn songs more bug-like then bird-like. And parrots, like this one named Einstein...

EINSTEIN: Hello.

CHAD COHEN: ...can even mimic other species...

EINTSTEIN'S TRAINER: Can you do a pig?

EINSTEIN: Oink, oink, oink, oink.

CHAD COHEN: ...adding new words to their repertoire all the time.

TRAINER: What does everyone say in Tennessee?

EINSTEIN: Yahoo!

CHAD COHEN: Einstein seems content to receive a treat for displaying his vocal talents. In the wild though, male songbirds use their song to defend territory or to woo a mate. The guy with the best song gets the girl, but to get her, he's got to be creative...

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Every individual bird has his own song, has his own performance, so they imitate, but they also diverge and vary.

CHAD COHEN: ..and in the process, create rather sophisticated melodies.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: So here is a song of a veery. Let's listen to it a little. Does it sound musical to you?

CHAD COHEN: It sounds like a bird.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Now I'll slow it down for you.

CHAD COHEN: That's incredible. That's incredible. That's the same bird?

Birdsong is so elegant it's inspired the great masters. Mozart borrowed these notes from his beloved starling. When his muse died, the distraught maestro even gave it a formal funeral and wrote a poem in its honor.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Let me play you something and see if it reminds you of a piece of music. So here is a wood wren song.

CHAD COHEN: So, that's Beethoven's Fifth out of the mouth of a wood wren. That's just crazy. That's just crazy.

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: Beethoven was really a fraud, uh?

CHAD COHEN: Yeah. So which came first, though?

OFER TCHERNICHOVSKI: He came first, I can tell you that, at least a few thousand years earlier.

CHAD COHEN: Duke University neurologist Erich Jarvis thinks we have a lot more in common with songbirds than first meets the ear. He's been studying bird brains and comparing them with ours.

ERICH JARVIS (Neurobiologist, Duke University): The basic similarity between songbirds and humans is that we both have cerebral brain areas that control learned vocal behavior.

CHAD COHEN: So, if you look at the cerebral areas of my brain, for example, this area back here helps me understand the words I hear. Whereas, a little bit further up, this area helps me produce the actual words. It's taking no less then 100 muscles, by the way, just for me to be telling you this. And before I can utter a single word, that word-understanding area and that word-producing area need to talk to each other through some sophisticated circuitry.

A songbird's brain also has areas that process and produce sound, and these areas are also connected through sophisticated circuitry.

JUAN URIAGEREKA: For an organism that is so distant from us, that's quite remarkable. Nature is playing a very slick trick, right there.

CHAD COHEN: A trick that Dr. Santosh Helekar is using to help unravel the mystery of speech. He's exploring a troubling speech disorder...

DENNIS: I love to, to, to, to, to, to...

CHAD COHEN: ...stuttering, a condition that causes patients, like Dennis, to get stuck on syllables. Believe it or not, Santosh thinks that some of his zebra finches have a similar problem. Yep, it appears songbirds stutter, too.

SANTOSH HELEKAR (Baylor College of Medicine): A normal birdsong of a zebra finch consists of a sequence of syllables that are repeated over and over again.

CHAD COHEN: This is the sonogram of a normal zebra finch song. A simple melody, consisting of several syllables repeated over and over again. But Santosh's stuttering birds sing like this.

They get stuck on one syllable and keep repeating it over and over again, not unlike what's happening to Dennis.

HENNING VOSS: Hi, Santosh. How are you?

SANTOSH HELEKAR: Hi, Henning. How are you? I brought some birds.

CHAD COHEN: To find out why, Santosh, along with colleague Henning Voss of the Weill Medical College of Cornell, decide to scan the brains of these pint-size stutterers.

To do it, they have to adapt an fMRI machine, designed for a human brain, to scan one a lot smaller. Henning creates this coil to do the job.

Once the tiny patient is mildly sedated, it's put inside the coil and into a soundproof box, equipped with headphones. Then bird, box and all, are placed into the fMRI and the scanning begins.

HENNING VOSS: We will see the brain from the side.

CHAD COHEN: They soon pick up a signal.

HENNING VOSS: This is the forebrain, the cerebellum. Here, one can see midbrain and spinal cord coming out, and the beak.

CHAD COHEN: Now it's time for the entertainment portion of our program.

The tiny patient is played a familiar melody, the song of its father, who first taught him how to sing.

As it listens, the scanner picks up increased blood flow in the part of the brain used to process sound.

HENNING VOSS: Okay, we have very nice activations...

SANTOSH HELEKAR: ...smack in the middle of the hearing center of the brain.

CHAD COHEN: The scans show nice activation, but when they compare the results of these stuttering birds with scans of normal birds, they find a difference.

SANTOSH HELEKAR: A stuttering bird's brain doesn't have the same pronounced activation as a normal bird has.

CHAD COHEN: And here's where it gets really interesting. It turns out, similar activation patterns are found in human stutterers. Stutterers have less activity in an area of the brain used to process sound than normal speakers do.

This connection between human brains and bird brains poses yet another question for researchers: how did two distinctly different species end up with, not only intriguingly similar vocal learning systems, but similar speech disorders? The answer may lie in our genes.

Back in the 1990s, researchers found a genetic link to language, when they discovered an English family suffering from a rare speech disorder.

INTERVIEWER: Where do you live Laura?

LAURA: (inaudible)

ROBERT C. BERWICK (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): This family had extreme difficulty with vocalization, moving their mouths around the right way, with putting the sounds in the right order.

CHAD COHEN: Genetic studies revealed a single gene mutation was the cause. The faulty gene, called FOXP2, was christened "the language gene."

ERICH JARVIS: That discovery prompted myself and Constance Scharff, a long time collaborator of mine, to examine whether or not something was similar in songbirds.

CONSTANCE SCHARFF (Free University of Berlin): Do birds have the FOXP2 gene? Because that wasn't clear at the time.

CHAD COHEN: Well, they not only found the FOXP2 gene in birds, they discovered how it influences the way a bird learns to sing.

ERICH JARVIS: When the young birds are learning how to imitate songs, the FOXP2 gene was going up.

CHAD COHEN: This enabled cells to produce more protein.

ERICH JARVIS: And after learning was complete, it went down. Not only that, we found that in canaries, who can continue to learn song throughout life, at the time of the year they're learning to imitate new songs, the FOXP2 gene goes up again.

CHAD COHEN: An amazing discovery that brings with it a whole other set of questions. FOXP2 is found in just about everything from fish to yeast.

CONSTANCE SCHARFF: Even in flies and bees. So it's not the gene that makes us speak. It's a gene that is being used in many neighborhoods.

CHAD COHEN: Erich Jarvis, for one, is committed to figuring this out. He's set his sights on identifying other genes that may hold the key to why we can speak, birds can sing and others, even our closest relatives, cannot.

It's not for lack of communication skills. Since the 1970s, researchers have demonstrated that chimps understand our words and can even answer back.

ERICH JARVIS: Chimps have this ability of sign language. They already have language with the hands, they just can't do it with the voice.

CHAD COHEN: Jarvis theorizes that a few unknown genes give us something the chimps don't have, that neural circuitry connecting the word-understanding area of our brain to the word-producing area. Without this circuitry, he surmises, chimps can't speak.

ERICH JARVIS: It's not such a crazy idea to think that a few genes have to be mutated to get such a system in the brain.

CHAD COHEN: A system that gives us the gift of gab and our feathered friends inspiring melodies.

JUAN URIAGEREKA: I love these little guys, but now doubly so, because they're a model organism. We can seriously study them.

CHAD COHEN: Whether it's through words or song, one thing's for certain. We aren't the only ones with something to say.

TRAINER: How about a chimpanzee.

EINSTEIN: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah.
SPACE STORMS

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Welcome back. A breaking story tonight: big storm brewing. We've got a meteorologist in the field.

Can you hear me?

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON (As Meteorologist): Yes. As you can see, I'm in the thick of it out here!

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Excuse me, but where are you?

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON (As Meteorologist): I'm out in space, orbiting Earth. And believe it or not, there's some serious storms up here. And they can cause all kinds of problems down there, especially with communications systems.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: ...seem to be having technical difficulties.

In the meantime, check this out.

Anyone who has seen the aurora borealis, or northern lights, will tell you they're one of nature's most spectacular performances, a celestial ballet of light, dancing across the night sky.

But it turns out there's much more to this dazzling display than meets the eye, because the same thing that powers the dance of the northern lights can also wreak havoc, exposing astronauts to deadly amounts of radiation, frying electrical systems in satellites and overwhelming power grids, causing widespread blackouts.

Problem is no one has ever been able to agree on the exact choreography of events that gives rise to both this beauty and danger.

JOHN BONNELL (University of California, Berkeley): This has been one of the persistent and difficult questions to solve in space physics.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: But now, an unusual space mission is aiming to solve this mystery once and for all because figuring out what makes the northern lights dance may also hold the key to predicting these kinds of events and avoiding disaster.

The northern lights take place more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface. But they're not caused by weather on Earth. They're caused something much less familiar, called "space weather."

Now, some of you may be thinking, "Space weather? It can't possibly rain or snow in space. I mean, you don't see astronauts shoveling out the Space Station, do you?" Well, turns out space has its own special kind of weather, thanks to that big ball of glowing gas we call the Sun.

Every day, the sun spews out a million tons of electrically charged particles, which race away, at up to 300 miles per second, forming what's known as the solar wind.

Most of these particles are deflected by Earth's magnetic field, the protective shield that envelopes our planet. But some sneak through and eventually collide with air molecules. When they hit oxygen, you get a red or a green glow; nitrogen, a blue glow, creating a steady ring of lights around the north and south magnetic poles.

But sometimes the whole process goes berserk. Huge amounts of energy from the solar wind build up in Earth's magnetic field and then are released in a sudden explosion called a substorm. And you can tell when that happens because the northern lights start to dance.

VASSILIS ANGELOPOULOS (U.C.L.A.): So the eruption of the aurora really corresponds to an eruption of a substorm, an energy release out in space.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: But where do these violent space storms begin?

To find out, a team has launched a mission, called Themis, consisting of five identical satellites.

Wait a minute. Five satellites? Isn't that overkill?

Well, to see why they needed that many, think of a tsunami. A single buoy in the ocean can tell you if a tsunami has taken place. But if you want to figure out which way that wave is moving and how fast, you need multiple buoys, and it's the same with substorms. Except instead of buoys in the ocean, the Themis mission is using satellites.

The goal of the mission is to figure out where substorms start. And once every four days, the satellites enter the region of space where substorms occur to detect if they erupt near Earth or farther out in the magnetic field.

The Themis mission is operated at the University of California at Berkeley.

What am I looking at?

STAFF MEMBER: Now you can see...

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: I see Earth in the middle.

UCLA STAFF MEMBER: That's right, and the five satellite orbits off to the right discovers four days worth of orbit tracks.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And it's very clear when they all line up.

UCLA STAFF MEMBER: Exactly.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Themis is named for the Greek goddess of justice, that blindfolded lady holding the scales on courthouses. And just as the goddess weighed competing explanations to determine the truth, the Themis mission will try to discover the truth about substorms.

The evidence will be gathered by huge antennas on each satellite. And to see how they packed five of these into just one rocket, I paid a visit to one of the guys who designed them.

So where have you brought me? What is this place?

JOHN BONNELL: Well, so this is the mechanical engineering lab.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: One antenna was designed like a high-tech jack-in-the-box. It was nicknamed "the death spike" for reasons that would soon become obvious.

JOHN BONNELL: And when I pull this string, it's going to release.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Can I give you a countdown?

JOHN BONNELL: Yes, go ahead.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Okay, ready? Five, four, three, two, one...

JOHN BONNELL: So, as you can see, about ten-foot up.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And with these antennas deployed, the team hopes the satellites will be in the right place at the right time, to catch a substorm in action.

JOHN BONNELL: It's like we've laid this trap, we've gone to the jungle, and we're waiting for the tiger.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And missions like Themis come not a moment too soon.

The sun works on an 11-year cycle, its activity level rising and falling with the number of magnetic disturbances, called sunspots, visible on the surface. Over the years, people have tried to link the sunspot cycle to everything from skirt lengths to stock prices. But the one thing we know it does relate to is space weather. And right now, we're entering a new solar cycle which will peak between 2011 and 2012.

When that happens, the first to know about it will be the nation's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. Here, a special breed of weathermen keeps their eyes on the Sun, 24/7.

KEN: ...sonar terrestrial indices for 29...

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Drawing on observations, data from satellites, experience and a strong dose of intuition, they issue alerts and warnings, as well as a daily space weather forecast.

KEN: No space weather storms are expected for the next 24 hours.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: So who needs a space weather forecast? Well, NASA for one; and everyone from utility companies to satellite operators would like even longer-range forecasts, like we have for weather on Earth. But that's a tall order.

TOM BOGDAN (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center): Space weather is much more difficult to predict than terrestrial weather. First of all, the volume of space between us and the Sun is 93 million miles cubed, in size. It's huge.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: To get a handle on such an enormous volume, space physicists just up the road from the Prediction Center are trying to build computer models to forecast space weather.

The results look like this: a simulation predicting how hard the solar wind's blowing, the direction of the magnetic field and the appearance of the northern lights.

But today, these models can only make forecasts about an hour in advance.

MIKE WILTBERGER (National Center for Atmospheric Research): We are, in essence, back at where weather forecasting was in the 1950s. We're just, kind of, getting started into this system and making progress. But it's a kind of exciting time to be in this, because you're at the beginning of a new capability in providing these tools.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Meanwhile, to gather information to improve those tools, the Themis satellites continue lining up, every four days, in Earth's magnetic field, lying in wait for substorms.

It would be fun to be on one of these satellites, as you sort of come into alignment.

VASSILIS ANGELOPOULOS: And watch one of these auroras break up at the same time.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: No, I don't want to be there for that.

It takes two days for data from the outermost satellite to download to Earth. And it will take months or even years to analyze. But in previous alignments, the team's already been lucky, snaring several substorms.

VASSILIS ANGELOPOULOS: This is where the three substorms took place. One took place here, the next one about an hour later, and the next one about...yet another hour later.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: That's these peaks?

VASSILIS ANGELOPOULOS: These peaks.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: That's the bleeding edge of the frontier of science?

VASSILIS ANGELOPOULOS: That is exactly right.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And if their luck holds, they'll catch enough substorms in this two-year mission to figure out the physics needed to improve space weather prediction and to solve the mystery of what makes the aurora dance.
PROFILE: YOKY MATSUOKA

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Here at NOVA scienceNOW, we've always considered it the epitome of cool to be smart and into science, but sometimes kids think they have to choose between being smart and being popular.

Well, in this episode's profile, you'll meet a popular kid who finally decided to embrace her inner geek, and now she's reaping the rewards.

At age 37, Yoky Matsuoka is finally not afraid to stand out.

At the University of Washington, Yoky is a pioneer in neurobotics, an emerging field that combines neuroscience with building robots. Yoky won the MacArthur "genius" award for this visionary work.

YOKY MATSUOKA: It's easy to describe Star Wars and say, "Remember the scene where Luke goes...and then moves the hand around, and it looks like a real hand, but there's a little door that opens on the arm, and there are all mechanical pieces moving around?" And that's what I make.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Thanks to her, people who need them will someday have prosthetic hands that will look and move like real human hands. And what makes Yoky's hand so remarkable is that it will be controlled directly by the human brain.

RODNEY BROOKS (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): I don't think Yoky's ever just one of the crowd. She's doing stuff that's very different from what other people are doing, and I think she enjoys being out there on the edge.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Growing up in Tokyo, Japan, Yoky always knew somewhere, deep down, she was not like other kids.

YOKY MATSUOKA: I knew that I wasn't the same as everybody else. Somehow, something was different.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Then she found the most unlikely of soul mates.

YOKY MATSUOKA: When I first saw John McEnroe? I bet I was about five or eight. He had a personality that was different from other people. He really stood out. I think that's why he was called the "bad boy" of tennis.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: At age 11, Yoky started playing tennis, too. But as a girl in Japan, she knew she could never be like John McEnroe.

YOKY MATSUOKA: Oh yeah, it's not acceptable to be bold; it's not acceptable to really express your opinions, especially as a girl. I think I was afraid to show that I was different, and I admired people who could show that they are different and not be afraid of it.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Tennis became Yoky's obsession and her identity. And she was good.

When Yoky was 16, her parents, both former athletes, sent Yoky to the United States, with the hope of her becoming a professional tennis player.

YOKY MATSUOKA: I was really pushing and playing a lot of tennis—maybe three and a half hours of tennis and one hour conditioning every day.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And at her new high school, in Palm Bay, Florida, she tried hard to fit in. She studied the show Friends for hours on end, to learn English and how to act like the perfect American girl. She even changed the spelling of her name.

YOKY MATSUOKA: My real name was Yoko. And I often got expressions saying, "Oh you're Yoko, just like Yoko Ono." And I changed my last letter from o to y, to "Yoky."

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Yoky was fitting in, but when she began to do well in math and science, she started to stand out in a way she didn't like.

YOKY MATSUOKA: Whenever I received an award, whether it's a science award or a math award, my friends would come over and say, "You got an award, so you are smart?" And then I would say, "No, no. That's just a mistake. I don't know anything about it. I don't know what they're thinking, but since they're going to give me an award, I'll just take it."

It sounded like a geek or a nerd. And I just didn't want to be that. As girls, we all wanted to be accepted as pretty girls or athletic girls, not the science girls or math girls. If people perceived me as an airhead, then that gained my popularity; I get to have cool friends.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Yoky was so afraid of looking like a nerd that she wouldn't be seen carrying a book.

YOKY MATSUOKA: I even got to the point where I pretended that I was never studying and then just hid in the library for two days before the test, and then I studied. I had to live a double life. I never tried to just stop learning math and science. I just secretly did it.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: On the tennis court, Yoky was on the fast track to becoming a pro. She even reached the qualifying rounds for Wimbledon. But Yoky's body could not withstand the stress.

YOKY MATSUOKA: The first tennis injury, I sprained my ankle so bad that, basically, the bone came off with it. Since then, almost every year I had a pretty severe injury.

I broke my ankle three times, I snapped my Achilles tendon, I snapped my patella tendon, I hurt my back, I had split quad muscles.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: She secretly dreamt of creating a robotic tennis partner to help her strengthen her body and keep training through her injuries.

YOKY MATSUOKA: And I thought, well you know, "I know some science and I know some robotics. Wouldn't that be great, if I can build a robot that, you know, has multiple knobs, and said, ‘Oh today, this person should have this kind of spin on the serve?' Or somebody else, who just would just not miss any balls but would not hit really hard, you know, push me just the right amount every day."

So that's really the first time I started thinking a robotic tennis player would be great.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Due to injuries, Yoky never played professional tennis. But she did get to build robots. At M.I.T., she studied under the world-famous roboticist, Rodney Brooks.

RODNEY BROOKS: So, in principle, I see no reason that we can't build a robot, eventually, that is as capable as a human being.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Like John McEnroe, Rodney was known as the bad boy in his world.

YOKY MATSUOKA: Rod is called "bad boy" of robotics because he also has an attitude. He thinks wild ideas that other people won't think of and won't accept.

RODNEY BROOKS: I went around reveling in being different and reveling in telling everyone else they were wrong.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Rodney was working on Cog, a cutting edge humanoid robot.

YOKY MATSUOKA: Different body parts were up for grab.

"Which body part would you like to work on?" And I said, "Well, you know, I'm a tennis player. I'd really like to understand more about arms and hands. So I think I'm going to work on hands."

RODNEY BROOKS: So this is the hand that Yoky built for her master's thesis. It fit along the end of an arm for Cog.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: It was the first robotic hand that Yoky ever built.

RODNEY BROOKS: Yoky used to always surprise me, because she would go into a field where she knew nothing, really, and within three or four weeks, she'd be knowing everything about it and making contributions there.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: She thrived in this new field, but Yoky was still hiding. She wouldn't even buy books because she was afraid of seeming smart.

YOKY MATSUOKA: Second year of graduate school at M.I.T., I had to put a nametag and it says "Hello my name is," and I was supposed to put "Yoky" on it. But I thought it would be really cool if I put "Airhead." I looked around at everybody's faces, and I didn't see all positive like, "Yeah, girl. Go girl!"

My advisor, Rod Brooks, came and, basically, pulled me on the side and said, "Look, Yoky. This is not going well. Stop acting like an airhead. It's not going to take you far, as long as you're acting this way." And that's the day that it really hit me hard and I thought, "Wow. Now I understand. Okay, I'm going to stop doing this. Acting airhead is not the right dual life that I should be living in anymore." That was one of the few turning points in my life.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Now, 10 years later, Yoky has her own lab at the University of Washington and is working on a new robotic hand. Except this time, it's a robotic hand for humans.

YOKY MATSUOKA: The hand is really amazing. Hands set us apart from other species. You know we built this society because we can use tools. So that means that people who are disabled and can't use their hands, they're not given back this full human capability. I really want to give that function back to those people.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Yoky is building a prosthetic hand that will look and move exactly like a real human hand.

BRIAN DELLON (University of Washington): The index finger, for example, has seven muscles. That means we need seven motors to control and make it work exactly like a human finger would. When the motor moves, it pulls these strings, just like a puppet, and the finger will then move in the correct way.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: They use infrared cameras to track exactly how the muscles in the hand move.

BRIAN DELLON: We put reflective markers on an object, say, your finger.

YOKY MATSUOKA: As I move my finger and record the motion itself, I can play that back using my robotic finger.

So if I curl my knuckle joint, then I can make the robot to curl the knuckle joint the same way.

BRIAN DELLON: As you tense and release your muscles, they actually generate electrical activity, and so we're trying to tease out the some of different ways the brain controls our fingers and our muscles, as we're trying to do a certain task.

YOKY MATSUOKA: One day, people are going to be walking around with a prosthetic hand, which...nobody can tell it's prosthetic. It moves like it, it looks like it, it's controlled naturally from the brain. That's how it's going to be.

I really wanted to be somebody who sticks out, be different, have an attitude. If people say, "Hey, you have an attitude," I think, to me, that's a compliment.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And with her mathematician husband, Simon, Yoky lives this attitude both inside and outside her lab.

YOKY MATSUOKA: I am the first generation who is openly having this dual life and saying, "You know what? I'm not going to wait 'til tenure. I'm going to start having my kids." And it's really exciting, but it's really, really hard.

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: Using her MacArthur "genius" award money, Yoky's on a mission to pave the way for the next generation of women in science.

YOKY MATSUOKA: What I really would like to do is to change the image of math and science. And if I could really change that image, then it's okay to be smart. And it's okay to be a girl and then still be able to pursue math and science, and it's accepted.

I'd like to be role model, and I want them to see that that's what I'm doing, and to achieve that and then do better than me.
SMART BRIDGES

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: As we travel around by car, we expect the bridges we have to cross to be safe and secure. But many of them are very old, and a few have already collapsed. Wouldn't it be great if engineers could create a technology so that bridges could tell us what's wrong and how to fix it, before it's too late?

Correspondent Peter Standring reports on efforts to prevent another tragedy like the one that happened in Minneapolis not long ago.

911 OPERATOR (female): Minneapolis 911.

911 CALLER (female): The bridge collapsed! People are stacked up on 35! The whole bridge fell into the river!

PETER STANDRING (Correspondent): At the end of rush hour, on a hot summer day, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a major bridge over the Mississippi River suddenly collapsed.

911 CALLER (male): I think there are people trapped in cars is what I'm really worried about.

911 CALLER (female):...in the river, there are cars sinking and people in their cars.

911 OPERATOR (male): We know, ma'am. Everyone's on the way.

PETER STANDRING: Over 100 cars fell with the bridge, among them, a community center school bus carrying 54 children.

SASHA BOUYE (Waite House Neighborhood Center): ...and then, all of a sudden out of nowhere, it was just this big drop.

JULIE GRAVES (Waite House Neighborhood Center): It all...hit our heads, come back down, hit our heads, come back down. You just heard kids screaming.

SASHA BOUYE: Oh my god, oh my god! What happened, what happened?

PETER STANDRING: The disaster killed 13 people and seriously injured over 100 more. And if this bridge collapsed, what about all the others like it across the country?

JIM OBERSTAR (D-Minnesota, U.S. House of Representatives): We have 76,000 structurally-deficient bridges in the United States. That's almost two and a half times as many as we had 20 years ago. And we need more modern non-destructive technologies to inspect those bridges today, to make them safer for the future.

PETER STANDRING: The cause of the Minneapolis collapse is still under a federal investigation, but here's what we know: the Minneapolis bridge was an under-deck truss-arch design made up of twin trusses of steel beams arranged in triangles and connected with steel plates, called gussets. The trusses distribute the weight of the traffic throughout the structure, all the parts working together. But the design has no backup against failure. If one major part fails, the whole bridge can come crashing down.

Investigators found that 16 of those connecting gusset plates failed, resulting in the catastrophic collapse.

The tragedy was seen as a wake-up call, highlighting the need for technology that warns us before a bridge fails, technology appearing on bridges, even today.

About an hour's drive east of Minneapolis, along Interstate 94, you'll find this bridge, spanning the Red Cedar River, in Wisconsin. It has an under-deck truss-arch design that's almost identical to the bridge that collapsed.

In fact, this one is 10 years older. So down below, on its aging steel structure, crews from the Wisconsin department of transportation are installing sensors to give it a kind of high tech physical.

This will keep me in the basket?

FINN HUBBARD (Bridge Engineer): This will keep you attached to the basket.

PETER STANDRING: I'm not crazy about heights, but the only way to see for myself was to climb into the basket, as bridge engineer Finn Hubbard took me up, over the edge and under the bridge.

FINN HUBBARD: We're coming back now, and taking a look at it with our sensors, today, to find out how the bridge is doing inside, if you will, looking at the stress and the strain, the forces inside the members themselves.

PETER STANDRING: The sensors, called strain gauges, are welded onto critical spots on the bridge.

FINN HUBBARD: What that does is it actually measures the strain, which is that actual stretching of the metal, sort of like stretching a rubber band.

PETER STANDRING: The gauge is attached to the bridge, so that when the steel stretches, the gauge stretches, changing its electrical resistance. By comparing the gauges' readings to the way the bridge is supposed to perform, Finn can tell if the metal is overly stressed.

Do you think that, ultimately, this is making for a safer bridge, or at least is going to give you the information that you need to keep it safe?

FINN HUBBARD: I think what it's going to do is give us that added measure of insurance that the bridge is behaving the way the computer model back in the office is saying it is.

PETER STANDRING: But strain gauges have serious limitations. They can only give you one type of information at one spot on the bridge. And they can't warn you of an imminent collapse.

If we could only probe deep inside an old bridge's inner structure to find out which are in danger and which are sound...Well, turns out we can, the same way that submarines detect other boats, using the echoes of sound waves, or sonar.

At the University of California, San Diego, they're using a kind of sonar technology to find cracks in bridges. They're called piezoelectric sensors, and they can both send and receive high frequency tones right through a bridge.

ERIC FLYNN (Structural Engineer): So this one will launch a wave into the structure, while this white one, here, will then detect the signal at the other end.

PETER STANDRING: The wave is ultrasonic, so Eric's computer converts the signal so that we can hear it.

ERIC FLYNN: All right. So what we have here is our signal that we received on the healthy structure plate. And if we downshift that ultrasonic signal into the audible range, this is what we hear...very nice clear tone.

PETER STANDRING: But if you fracture that steel plate, the crack forces the ultrasonic waves to take different paths.

ERIC FLYNN: Now we replace that healthy beam with a damaged beam. Put the same sensors on it and apply the same signal again. This is what we get out. You can both see the difference and hear the difference: these extra tones that are now present in that damaged plate.

PETER STANDRING: So how would that work on a bridge? You can place a bunch of these devices around trouble spots like gusset plates, and then have them ping each other in different combinations, probing for problems, such as cracks in the structure.

MICHAEL TODD (Structural Engineer): What we do is we deploy arrays of these, many of these, on a structure, and then we launch waves, and we listen. And the idea then becomes, if you keep doing that test, and a crack has developed, maybe corrosion has occurred, a bolt is coming loose, or...the signature that we're detecting is going to fundamentally change.

PETER STANDRING: But the ideal technology would not only probe for damage and signal its location, it would literally show you where it's broken.

At the University of Michigan, researchers have developed a nanotech skin that could one day cover and monitor bridge, 24/7. Here they've successfully tested a coating that, when stimulated with an electric current, senses damage beneath its surface. And the secret of the sensing skin is the new wonder material of nanotechnology, carbon nanotubes.

Carbon nanotubes are microscopic tubes of carbon atoms that join up under extreme temperatures. Many times stronger and lighter than steel, carbon nanotubes are also amazing conductors of electricity, and it's the electrical properties of these tiny tubes that make the sensing skin possible.

JEROME LYNCH (University of Michigan): The honor is all yours, Peter.

PETER STANDRING: Breaking the skin, here we go.

JEROME LYNCH: Excellent.

PETER STANDRING: To test the system, Professor Jerry Lynch let me punch holes through a steel plate covered with nanotech skin.

JEROME LYNCH: So, with your incredible strength, you can see that you punctured all the way through the plate.

PETER STANDRING: The electricity passing through the skin creates a high resolution map on a computer, providing a visual representation of the puncture holes.

JEROME LYNCH: So the magnitude of damage would be correlated to the color-coding that we have here on our images.

PETER STANDRING: The skin could be sprayed or glued over critical bridge components. When damage starts to form, the skin's electrical current is forced to flow in different directions, change that a computer reads and displays as damage. And by altering the chemistry, different layers of the skin can be made to detect different types of damage—deformation, cracks, corrosion—all at the same time, catching threats before they become dangerous.

Could you envision, you know, a bridge engineer, sitting in his office, monitoring the wellbeing of a structure through a system like this?

JEROME LYNCH: Yes, that's one of the beauties of this particular technology...is how self-evident damage appears in these images.

PETER STANDRING: Within months of the Minneapolis collapse, construction on a replacement bridge is already underway.

LINDA FIGG (FIGG Bridge Engineers): This bridge is a big responsibility for restoring confidence. We expect our bridges to be safe and to get us where we need to be every day.

PETER STANDRING: The new bridge is being built of high density concrete, and its design includes multiple backups against failure and what is promised to be a state-of-the-art sensor system.

LINDA FIGG: The main concept is to have many different technologies working in concert. And, collectively, these will all work together to bring us the best data for the bridge.

PETER STANDRING: But even as the bridge takes shape, the scene evokes mixed feelings for Julie and Sasha.

SASHA BOUYE: I think this might be the only bridge that I may feel comfortable going across, because it is a new structure.

JULIE GRAVES: The new bridge, no matter how many times I cross it, for me, I'll just...I'm never going to get the sounds and the sight out of my head from the actual bridge collapse.

COSMIC PERSPECTIVE – NORTHERN LIGHTS

NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON: And now for some final thoughts on the northern lights.

Who would have guessed, long ago, what causes the aurora? Countless atomic and sub-atomic particles, released by the Sun, in resonance with its 11-year cycle, stream among the planets at speeds up to a million miles an hour. These charged particles see and respond to Earth's magnetic field: the positive and negative charges split north and south. They then gather and pulse, in ways still mysterious, as they collide with molecules of Earth's upper atmosphere.

The collisions render the air aglow, creating one of the most colorful and striking sights of the arctic night, as the sky fills with dancing curtains of light.

No doubt about it, the aurora is complex. To understand it requires a branch of advanced physics called magnetohydrodynamics, a field that's been known to make strong men weep.

Meanwhile, the aurora has been, and continues to serve as a fertile source of art, mythology and legend among Arctic peoples and their visitors, as it leaves viewers in silent awe of its majesty and beauty.

It's a curious thing about the universe: behind the most stunning phenomena to behold, lie some of the most challenging problems in astrophysics, from the colorful turbulence within planetary atmospheres, to stars in the throes of death, to the majestic patterns of spiral galaxies, to the large-scale structure of the universe itself. What distinguishes the aurora among them, is that you don't need a telescope to see it, just your eyes and a ticket to the arctic.

And that's the cosmic perspective.

NARRATOR: An amateur explorer, cruising the skies of the Australian outback, makes a chance discovery, a prehistoric cave that's never been explored. Inside, something no one's ever seen before: a mysterious fossil.

ULTRALIGHT GUY (Pilot): There was one particular skeleton, and I said, "Well, it doesn't look like an old cow to me. I wonder what it is?"

NARRATOR: The strange bones are the start of an adventure. A team of researchers launch an expedition to hunt for a long lost killer, as fearsome as any top predator today.

JOHN LONG (Western Australian Museum): This is, perhaps, one of the most important Western Australian Museum field trips I'm ever going to do.

NARRATOR: On a continent full of unique animals, they're on the trail of a powerful, prehistoric lion. For years, scientists have had only fragments of the lost predator to study, and its mysteries have remained unsolved.

ROD WELLS (Flinders University): It's an animal that's full of paradoxes. There's nothing quite like it that exists anywhere else in the world. I think it would be quite a fearful animal to encounter.

NARRATOR: Now, struggling in difficult conditions, the scientists have only a short time for a breakthrough.

JOHN LONG: Time to go, guys.

NARRATOR: It's a daring search, deep below the ground...

JOHN LONG: Each time they do it, they've got to treat it like it's their life in their hands.

NARRATOR: ...and a race against the threat of fossil poachers, who could steal the precious bones.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I wouldn't come any closer, actually. In fact, a whole skeleton could be right here.

NARRATOR: The team will work for three intense weeks to rescue the remnants of a unique ancient beast.

JOHN LONG: You know, this is something that us paleontologists dream of every day.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX (Western Australian Museum): This is, perhaps, one of the most important discoveries ever made in Australia.

NARRATOR: Right now, on NOVA, Bone Diggers.

Major funding for NOVA is provided by David H. Koch and by...

And by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you.

NARRATOR: The Australian outback: a vast, trackless wilderness filled with extraordinary creatures, including more than 200 different kinds of marsupials, which carry their babies in a pouch.

The outback is also home to one of the most ancient cultures on Earth, the aboriginal people who came to Australia about 50,000 years ago.

Their legends conjure up huge bizarre beasts, created in an ancient era called "the dreamtime" —long before the advent of humans—when heroic spirits summoned the landscape into being. The stories speak of wombats the size of buffalo, killer kangaroos, over eight feet tall. Could these aboriginal myths be a distant echo of something real?

A million or more years ago, an array of giant animals flourished here, distantly related to those on the outback today, but all of them died out toward the end of the last ice age.

In Perth, a team of Australian paleontologists are about to embark on a daring hunt for one of the lost prehistoric beasts. John Long is heading the expedition, a journey that started almost completely by chance.

JOHN LONG: I was sitting in my office, looking at the computer, and an email came through. And it was an email from someone I'd never met before. And then I saw there was an attachment. And I clicked on it, and as the attachment slowly opened, my jaw dropped.

NARRATOR: The attachment was a mysterious photo. It was taken in a newly discovered cave. It may be the find of a lifetime: the skeleton of an animal that's puzzled Australian scientists for over a hundred years.

JOHN LONG: I was totally elated and very excited. My first thoughts were that I had to mount an expedition, and we had to go and recover this remarkable fossil.

NARRATOR: Following directions that came with the email, Long and his colleagues set off on three full days of rugged driving, deep into the Australian outback.

JOHN LONG: This is, perhaps, one of the most important Western Australian Museum field trips I've ever been on, and perhaps one of the most dangerous missions I am ever going to do.

NARRATOR: They're heading to the Nullarbor Plain, more than 700 miles of almost uninhabitable land.

JOHN LONG: The Nullarbor is one of the great, vast, flat areas of Australia. It's a huge area covering several thousand square kilometers, very easy to get lost in because there just aren't any landmarks.

NARRATOR: Although it appears empty, the Nullarbor is home to many animals today, distant relatives of those enormous creatures that lived a million years ago.

JOHN LONG: There were giant goannas, the order of six meters in length. There were huge, gargantuan birds. The largest that ever walked on the planet came from Australia at this time, the dromornithids, or thunderbirds. We had a whole range of large animals, a bunch of giant kangaroos, and huge wombats the size of small cars. And at that time, it was kill or be killed. And it was pretty well cutthroat.

NARRATOR: Of all the prehistoric animals, one of the most mysterious is a marsupial lion called Thylacoleo carnifex. Very little is known about Thylacoleo. Fossil fragments have been found scattered across Australia, but never a complete skeleton. And that is what John Long thinks is pictured in the email.

At the end of a long drive, they finally make camp. For three weeks they'll live in harsh and isolated conditions.

JOHN LONG: We were about almost 2,000 kilometers from Perth and almost 900 kilometers to the nearest town. You have to bring in all your food, all your fuel, all your water, all your expertise, and then just do your work.

NARRATOR: In the middle of this desert, they'll be at the mercy of the elements. Temperatures in the daytime soar over a hundred degrees and then drop to freezing at night. And when the wind kicks up, it can literally blow the camp away. But this parched landscape was formed in a totally different environment than it is today.

JOHN LONG: Right here, where I'm standing, 20 million years ago was the bottom of the sea, limestone rock was formed. Today, the Nullarbor Plain is vast and featureless, but below ground is a different story. When ground waters rose up, percolating through that limestone rock, dissolving away calcium carbonate, the result was the formation of caves. Today there are thousands of caves throughout the Nullarbor region.

NARRATOR: Only a few of those caves are known to contain fossils. Concealing their location is critical, because there's a thriving international black market in ancient animal bones.

JOHN LONG: ...very important, because of the security of this cave, that we don't, we do not all walk in the same line.

NARRATOR: They spread out and never take the same route to the cave twice. Leaving tracks in the scrub could give away the location of the site to poachers, and priceless material could be lost to science.

It's going to be tricky just getting inside the cave. The only way down is on a harness and ropes. The scientists carefully build a scaffold at the mouth of the cave so they can lower themselves into the darkness. This will be the only safe way out if anything goes wrong.

JOHN LONG: It's about an 18-meter drop to the floor, and then the cabins go on, you know, in all directions, but for quite a way.

NARRATOR: For many members of the team, this kind of exploring is a completely new experience. They spend most of the first day at the campsite, learning to use their gear. Any mistake could be fatal.

JOHN LONG: Basically, each time they do it, they've got to treat it like it's their life in their hands.

Use your legs and keep straight.

NARRATOR: No matter how experienced the scientists are, the winds at the cave entrance can be treacherous.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: While you're on the rope or the ladder, you're often getting buffeted around, so you've got to be very careful at all times.

JOHN LONG: Use your legs.

NARRATOR: The next three weeks will be a test of endurance and patience. But it's also the chance for a unique scientific discovery.

JOHN LONG: You know this is something that us paleontologists dream of every day: a wonderful new discovery that we can then go out and collect and work on.

NARRATOR: Tomorrow the real adventure will begin.

JOHN LONG: Time to go, guys.

NARRATOR: The moment has come to descend into the dark depths of the cave.

JOHN LONG: Okay, just give Eve a "hi," and let her know you're coming down.

CAVER: Okay, Eve, I'm coming down.

NARRATOR: It's a 50-foot straight drop from the surface.

JOHN LONG: It's total, pitch black darkness, mostly totally silent. You do get a bit of wind and a bit of air diffusing through the caverns and the rocks at times, but mostly it's pretty isolated, probably about as isolated and lonely as you can get, anywhere in the world.

We dropped down, and we had to go right to the bottom of another large cavern. And then we had to crawl on our hands and knees through another narrow passageway.

This is the first time I've ever had to work in really close spaces in a cave, and it was a bit claustrophobic for me, I had to sort of adapt to it.

NARRATOR: Carefully, the team begins searching the enormous cave.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Fossils are not always draped on a nice flat surface. One has to often crawl down between the spaces between the rocks and come in from underneath to get the remainder of the bones. And sometimes the rocks are fairly precarious, so there is an element of risk.

JOHN LONG: It's a good one. Give me your hands, both hands.

NARRATOR: Piece by precious piece, they start to uncover ancient bones. Some are so fragile that just a touch could destroy them.

JOHN LONG: See, this is a major job, to get someone in here, just with a light brush, to brush away the gypsum, consolidate the bone.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Yeah, it's a beautifully preserved bone too. Now, of course, if we could find some teeth or a bit of jaw or a bit of skull, that will enable us to put a definite identification on this.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I wouldn't come any closer, actually. I think there's bone all through this area. In fact, a whole skeleton could be right here.

NARRATOR: The floor of the cave is littered with fossils.

JOHN LONG: Here we have the remains of giant kangaroos, three meters high, huge wombats the size of ponies, and, in addition to that, we've got weird species: kangaroos, wallabies, species that are quite rare and haven't been found in many other places.

NARRATOR: It looks like the cave was a prehistoric deathtrap. They find many of the bones directly under the small opening on the surface.

JOHN LONG: I can imagine that a giant wombat or a kangaroo just running along, didn't see the hole, fell straight down. Who knows? All we know is that, in terms of geological time, you only have to have one animal fall down a hole every hundred years, and over the course of several thousand years, it mounts up to a lot of skeletons.

NARRATOR: They break for the day, but there's a wealth of fossils waiting to be recovered. And they know that somewhere under this ancient soil is the big prize: the skeleton John Long saw in the email, before they left Perth.

They only have three weeks, so time is of the essence. They have to be as efficient as possible.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I'll get the other guys—Marc and Jeff and maybe Benny—into that new chamber.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Move on to the next one.

JOHN LONG: Leave no corner of the cave unsearched...bound to be more treasures hidden there, somewhere.

NARRATOR: As they continue their hunt, they find of hundreds of bones. Many are familiar, belonging to species found at other sites. But then comes a stunning realization. This cave holds hidden treasure, unique new skeletons of extinct species, previously unknown to science.

JOHN LONG: This is the most weirdest kangaroo I've ever seen in my life, great big whacking great horns sticking out over its eyes: bloody devil wallaby.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It's certainly a new species. And I think there's an excellent chance that it's probably a new genus and species, so it's a major find...and a complete skeleton, too.

NARRATOR: Over the course of several days, they realize there's an entire community of ancient animals in the cave. They find eight new species of prehistoric kangaroo, and other lost animals that are many times bigger than their relatives today. It's an unprecedented discovery.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It's one of the most important finds ever made in the history of Australian paleontology. There's never been a cache of fossils of this age—complete skeletons scattered around the cave floor—so it's given us an excellent window into the fauna of a massive part of Australia, about which we previously knew nothing.

NARRATOR: But just as they had feared, poachers have been here. In one part of the cave, there's evidence that poachers arrived before they did and raided some of the fossils.

JOHN LONG: It hasn't taken long for the cave to start to be trashed. You've got tire marks going in there and then tracks all the way along, then you go to this cave and there's been people in there. Some of the specimens there were disarticulated. But not only that, we don't have the complete picture. When we start logging and mapping each bone by bone, some of the puzzle's missing. So it's just not good.

NARRATOR: Could the poachers have already stolen the skeleton from the email? Hours of searching pass, and then one member of the team makes a promising discovery.

EVE TAYLOR (Archeologist): I was just coming down the rock pile here, and I saw, down the slots, the larger bones of the legs. Then I came around to get a better look, and there I saw some bones.

JOHN LONG: Oh yeah, look at that. There are some big bones there that look like the leg limb bones, and also vertebrae, and a bit of hip and possibly the other lower jaw.

NARRATOR: They immediately recognize that these bones are fragments of a giant extinct lion—a tantalizing clue, but not a complete skeleton.

Then, the moment they've been hoping for. They find the bones from the email, the first complete head-to-toe skeleton of Thylacoleo carnifex ever discovered.

JOHN LONG: I will never forget that moment, as long as I live, when I first laid eyes on the Thylacoleo skeleton. There it was, in reality, not just an image on a computer screen. I was totally gobsmacked, just entirely exhilarated from the inside out. It was a complete skeleton of Australia's largest marsupial killer.

NARRATOR: Every bone is still in place. The skeleton has been resting here in the darkness for thousands of years.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It was really quite poignant, because it was possible to tell just from, sort of, looking at the way the skeleton was laid out that that animal had taken its last breath exactly where it was lying. And you can just imagine it wandering along in the dark, dying of thirst or perhaps soft tissue injuries, collapsing, exhausted, and dying. It was quite remarkable.

NARRATOR: It's been a breakthrough day for the team. The find is a landmark in Australian paleontology. There's still a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time. They have an intense two weeks ahead of them as they face the challenge of bringing the precious skeleton to the surface.

Deep in the cave again, they begin to examine the bones more closely and there's more good news. The skeleton is untouched, lying exactly where the animal perished.

JOHN LONG: It's a pristine find. It's never been tampered with, and it gives us scientists the opportunity to go in, and not only to study the bones before we touch them, but to take samples for dating or ancient DNA. And we know there's no contamination down there, and that's very important for the science.

NARRATOR: They take samples for dating, because they want to know exactly how old the skeleton is.

JOHN LONG: It looked so well-preserved, I was thinking it might only be a few thousand years. It might be one of the youngest skeletons of megafauna yet discovered.

NARRATOR: They'll also try to recover ancient DNA from the bones, to look for clues about how Thylacoleo relates to modern species.

JOHN LONG: In modern creatures, it's easy to take a tissue sample and extract the DNA out of it. But when we look at fossils, it's often difficult to get DNA, unless you get very good preservation. Unfortunately, we didn't get any DNA out of those bones. But then the reason why became obvious when the dating results came in. The skeleton was far older than we'd ever imagined. It wasn't a few thousand years; it wasn't a few tens of thousands of years; it was probably half a million to a million years old.

NARRATOR: The skeleton's age and excellent condition make it even more valuable than the researchers had hoped, providing intimate details of the extinct lion's anatomy and behavior.

JOHN LONG: Okay, what I have here is the first-ever assembled tail of Thylacoleo, the marsupial lion. This is the only specimen known that had the tail complete. What you see is they had a long and muscular and powerful tail, the sort of tail befitting an animal that was an active predator.

NARRATOR: Before they can get the bones back to the lab, they need to prepare them carefully. One false move and the precious Thylacoleo skeleton could disintegrate before their eyes.

JOHN LONG: The skeleton was so fragile. Now, had someone actually tried to pick up the skull at that stage, it probably would have just fallen apart in their hands or fallen to dust, because it was very, very delicate.

NARRATOR: They spend days brushing on a special glue to harden the bones. It's a tedious job, but they have to do it before they can even pick up any of the bones.

JOHN LONG: After four days of painstaking work preparing the skull, today, we're finally able to pick it up and look at it in its entirety. And what we see is the powerful dentition: the big stabbing incisor at the front, this big shearing premolar. And when we look at the lower jaw, we see a similar arrangement: a powerful, stabbing incisor at the front and a shearing premolar and molar, which act like a pair of secateurs to cut through the flesh of giant three-meter kangaroos or big diprotodontine marsupials.

NARRATOR: The skull indicates that Thylacoleo's bite was incredibly powerful, equivalent to that of a modern lion, more than twice its size.

As the team continues to explore deeper into the cave, they find more specimens of the fearsome beast.

JOHN LONG: This is the eleventh Thylacoleo we've found in these caves, so far. And every specimen gives us new information that other material doesn't show. This particular animal came down in the cave and probably got wedged right here between the rocks. The head of the animal was here, and the front part of the arms fell down here.

NARRATOR: The unprecedented haul of bones poses an unexpected problem for the team. They can't possibly take all the fossils back to Perth.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Even if we took these jaws and left the rest....

NARRATOR: But if they leave anything behind, it may not be here when they come back.

JOHN LONG: There is this whole question of cave security and whether other people will get in and pinch bones and walk all over it. I'd still feel better if we at least got some of the better specimens, and we mark exactly where they came from.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Yeah, it's a big job. But it's a question of do you want to get the information that's available here out, or do we just want to scoop the goodies off the top and leave it at that?

JOHN LONG: These fossils haven't even been studied or described, and there's whole new species here, so the loss of knowledge, the loss of natural heritage is the main concern to me.

NARRATOR: They decide to take the eight new species of kangaroo, and several Thylacoleo specimens, including the rare intact skeleton. John Long personally tags and wraps each fragile bone for the journey back to the museum.

JOHN LONG: We numbered every single bone in the skeleton. We took loads of photographs documenting the relationship of every bone. And we very carefully hauled it up in drums on a rope to the top of the cave.

NARRATOR: But there's still one final hurdle. The difference in air pressure above and below the ground makes the wind howl through this narrow opening. One wrong move and their precious cargo could be smashed to bits against the limestone rock. Fortunately, their treasure makes the trip safely.

It's been a long, hard three weeks. But the journey of discovery will take a surprising turn as they return home to the museum to start a new exploration of Thylacoleo.

With the priceless skeleton back in Perth, John Long's colleagues from the Western Australian Museum join the investigation. In the lab, they'll be able to conduct a meticulous study of Thylacoleo, from head to toe.

JOHN LONG: Finding a complete skeleton of a marsupial lion is far more important than having hundreds and hundreds of isolated bits and pieces from different localities, because, for a start, we can build up an accurate picture of what the animal was like, and its real proportions. And we can also start to look at its functional morphology—how that animal operated as a creature. You know, how did its feeding mechanism work? How did its hands and feet work? How much movement was there in its shoulder and its backbone? And from these studies we can then start to build up a realistic idea of Thylacoleo as a living animal.

NARRATOR: Nineteenth century naturalists were the first to identify and describe Thylacoleo bones, and even with only fragments to go on, they realized how unusual a creature it was.

ROD WELLS: Sir Richard Owen described this animal back in 1859—the time Charles Darwin had just written his book on the evolution—as "the fellest of predatory beasts," and he called it Thylacoleo carnifex. Thylacis for pouch, leo for lion, carnae for meat and fex for cutting. So this was the "meat-cutting marsupial lion."

NARRATOR: But the name raised more questions than it answered. Marsupials share the characteristic feature of a pouch the females use to nurture their young. The specific bone structure needed to support a pouch in marsupials has been found in Thylacoleo skeletons.

Some marsupials live in other parts of the world, but Australia's geographic isolation contributed to the evolution of many unique species, like wombats, koalas and kangaroos. So the perplexing question is how did Thylacoleo, the extinct "meat-cutting lion," come to share features of both marsupials and big cats?

ROD WELLS: This is one of the most fascinating mammals, I think, that's ever been discovered. It's an animal that's full of paradoxes. There's nothing quite like it that exists anywhere else in the world.

NARRATOR: Rod Wells has been studying Thylacoleo most of his career. The best fossils he's had up 'til now are bits and pieces of skulls and teeth. So he starts his investigation of the new, complete skeleton with the parts he knows best, and right away he finds surprises.

ROD WELLS: This huge, single cutting tooth here, or premolar tooth, and this large premolar tooth, cutting premolar tooth, up here, are unprecedented in the mammalian world.

If we go to the front of the jaw, here, we have these two front teeth that extend here—a condition that is known as diprotodonte, Di for two, proto: front teeth, "two front teeth." And this is the condition that we find in all of the marsupials that are herbivorous. Things like possums and wombats and kangaroos and koalas all have this diprotodont condition. So here we have an animal that seems to be telling us, with one set of teeth, that it comes from a herbivore ancestry, and with another set of teeth, it's telling us it's a carnivore.

NARRATOR: Most of Thylacoleo's marsupial relatives today are plant eaters, but it seems clear that it was a hunter, like other lions.

To figure out this contradiction, the scientists have to look beyond its teeth.

MARK WALTERS (Research Scientist): I'd like a high resolution scan, one millimeter slices.

NARRATOR: Since this skull is so well preserved, it promises to deliver clues that have eluded previous researchers.

Mark Walters is a doctor who uses forensic techniques to rebuild shattered human faces and skulls. Today he's using a CT scanner for a different kind of detective work. For the first time, he will peer deep inside Thylacoleo's skull, and try to reconstruct the creature's ancient brain.

MARK WALTERS: CT data provides us with a stack of images, and we can bring those into the computer, and then we can create geometrical files. And from those geometrical files we can do a number of different types of manipulations, including taking a cast of the internal surface of the bones.

NARRATOR: The CT images are transformed into a plastic replica of the skull. Then Walters takes a set of precise measurements of the interior cavity. The final result is a remarkable three-dimensional cast of Thylacoleo's brain.

MARK WALTERS: There's a lot of information that can be derived from such a cast. We can see, quite clearly, the lumps and bumps on the bone. And they correspond to different parts of the brain. Well, the very first thing and obvious structure is that we see these very large olfactory lobes. So this animal is going to be able to detect its specific smells over very long distances. Also we can see the parts of the brain associated with sight. And we can also see the big nerves that go to the eyes. And these nerves are quite large, so you can see this animal also required a lot of good vision. So, what we can quickly see by this cast of the brain is that this animal had a very powerful sense of smell. It also had a good sense of hearing, and a very good sense of sight. So it was using all of its senses in its day to day activities.

NARRATOR: Many of today's marsupials are night creatures with keen senses of smell, sight and hearing. These are traits also shared by big cats.

With its powerful bite, Thylacoleo must have been as fearsome a predator as a lion. But the question of how it hunted is complicated by the strange configuration of its teeth.

ROD WELLS: Now, the problem with that is, of course, is how it actually catches its prey, because, in effect, these diprotodont teeth, when they mesh with the other upper incisors here, form something analogous to a parrot's beak. This animal could puncture a hole in the prey quite easily, but it would never be able to hang on to its prey.

NARRATOR: Somewhere in the new bones could be a clue to solve this problem. If Thylacoleo stabbed its victims with its large front teeth, how did it hold on to them while it finished them off?

The researchers find an answer in a part of its body they've never before been able to study in detail.

ROD WELLS: And here you will see the very large slashing claw on the thumb. So here was a mechanism whereby this animal could capture and hold its prey. So once Thylacoleo has grasped its prey, it's then in a position to deal the deathblow. And it can deal the deathblow with these sharply pointed lower incisor teeth. And of course, this would be an ideal way of doing things like severing the spinal cord, or suffocating the prey by grasping around the trachea.

NARRATOR: The evidence suggests that this ancient marsupial lion is fundamentally different from other marsupials, which lack such powerful teeth, and from other lions, which don't have its slashing claw. But without obvious parallels to these familiar predators today, its hunting habits remain a mystery.

Did Thylacoleo chase its prey? Did it hunt in packs? Or was it a stalker, laying in wait for the best moment to strike?

The scientists turn again to the new skeleton for answers. Each bone is carefully scanned so that 3D images can be manipulated on a computer screen.

MARK WALTERS: Oh, this is terribly exciting, because this animal doesn't exist. There's no other animal that exists like it. Through using this type of technology, we can reconstruct the anatomy of these animals to a detail that we've never seen before.

NARRATOR: These images help decipher how the bones were connected to each other and where muscles would have been attached. This gives the scientists a new understanding of Thylacoleo's legs and an important detail about the hunting techniques of the ancient predator.

ROD WELLS: There is nothing in the back part of the skeleton to suggest this animal was, in any way, a fast-moving animal. The hind legs are low-geared. They're powerful. And, indeed, if we look at the position where the muscle—the muscle scar—where the muscle comes off the thigh bone for rotating the thigh—about its fulcrum point here, it's attached way down here. So it's a very, very low-geared and powerful hind limb.

NARRATOR: Legs that are powerful but low to the ground mean Thylacoleo couldn't run fast for any significant distance. Chasing its prey would be out of the question; it would never have enough speed.

ROD WELLS: So I think this animal really is one that carefully stalks its prey. The speed comes with the speed with which it can slash with that forearm.

NARRATOR: As all of the new information about Thylacoleo's anatomy is falling into place, a scientific illustrator begins reconstructing its size and shape. The only things left to artistic license are the color and markings of its coat.

With the finished drawings as a guide, a scaled down model of Thylacoleo slowly takes form. Lasers scan the completed 3D model to produce digital images. And finally, the lost prehistoric predator comes back to life.

It was a fierce and stunning beast with a crushing bite and powerful legs, but it was low to the ground and heavy, not built for speed. Its feet had claws like a lion, but it walked flat like a bear. Since it was slow-moving, and probably able use its claws to climb trees, it may have ambushed its prey like some big cats today, laying in wait from above and then springing down on an unlucky victim.

And there's one final dramatic clue that seals its image as a deadly predator. The clue comes from the tail they discovered, intact, in the cave.

ROD WELLS: One of the interesting features of the tail is that...these little tiny bones here—these little v-shaped bones that are called chevrons, like on, like a roof or a chevron—and what they actually do is they protect the blood vessels that run underneath the tail at the point where the tail flexes down to the ground.

This is the sort of thing that you see in kangaroos. And kangaroos are capable of propping themselves up on the tail, tripoding, if you like, with the tail and the two hind legs. If this animal is actually catching its prey with its front legs and its slashing claw, being able to tripod back on the tail and the hind feet frees up the arm for slashing or grasping.

JOHN LONG: I have absolutely no doubt that an animal the size and bulk of Thylacoleo could have pulled down much larger animals, bigger than itself, like a giant wombat—phascolonus, the size of a small car—or giant herbivorous kangaroos. That is the sort of creature that would have been fodder for Thylacoleo.

ROD WELLS: My perceptions at this moment are of an opportunist carnivore scavenger that hunted at night, probably operated in woody shrub lands. I wouldn't want to have been a leaf-eating kangaroo with one of these guys around.

I would imagine that he operated on his own...probably sneak within very close range of the prey, and then leap at it...now either leap directly at it and grasp it with those big claws, maybe slash at it with the big claws, maybe leap onto its back and sever the spinal cord with the incisors, and then, just sit down and sheer off great lumps of flesh. I would imagine, if there were any dead animals around—this guy has got a very good sniffer—it would probably pick up the smell of carrion very easily. I think it would be quite a fearful animal to encounter.

NARRATOR: Thylacoleo ruled the Australian outback for more than a million years. Of the many large and formidable prehistoric animals, it was the deadliest, the king of beasts.

But toward the end of the Ice Age, something toppled Thylacoleo from its throne and drove it into extinction. How did this powerful killer, that could attack animals many times its size, become a victim?

CHRISTINE JANIS (Brown University): People always think that big predators are like the top of the heap, the king of beasts, the king of the jungle. And in fact, those big predators, particularly ones that sort of highly specialize in just eating meat, they're very vulnerable.

NARRATOR: Scientists are sharply divided about what caused Thylacoleo and all the other giant animals in Australia to die out. One view is that the final climax of cold conditions toward the end of the Ice Age, 30,000 years ago, pushed the great creatures into oblivion.

JOHN LONG: If you go into a maximum ice age and out of it again, in the period of 10,000 years, then you could certainly have major changes that put pressure on the environment and the animals that live in it.

NARRATOR: But a rival theory places the extinction much earlier, around 50,000 years ago. At that time, climate changes were probably less severe. And the first humans to arrive in Australia, the ancestors of today's aboriginal people, were entering the continent.

GIFFORD MILLER (University of Colorado): If we look at what was happening in Australia, 50,000 years ago or so, we can see a relatively stable climate, not that much different than today. And we also see that that's when the first humans colonized Australia. So it raises the question: could it be a human impact that's the main driver for these big extinctions?

NARRATOR: There's no way to prove that humans hunted prehistoric Australian animals aggressively enough to kill them all off, but other human activities could have helped eliminate the beasts.

GIFFORD MILLER: When humans come to Australia, we know they have fire on-demand. And so that's one of the tools people use in modifying landscapes to their benefit. And humans burn for a whole range of reasons. I mean, partly, they just burn to clear the land so that they can move across it. They hunt along the fire front, they signal distant bands, they promote the growth of plants that respond after burning. So there's many reasons why humans might be burning the landscape in a way that they thought was a positive impact.

NARRATOR: Whatever the reason, burning could have disrupted natural cycles of wildfire and re-growth, changing the vegetation and altering the habitat the giant animals depended on. Fires set by humans would narrow the range of plants to fire-resistant species. The landscape would turn to desert scrub land, and many of the browsing animals, like giant kangaroos, wouldn't have enough food to get by.

A predator like Thylacoleo, that couldn't suddenly switch its diet or hunting habits, would be highly vulnerable as its supply of prey dwindled.

GIFFORD MILLER: If the humans reduce the prey, that is, these other large browsers, on which the big carnivores are dependent—the carnivores are very sensitive to prey abundance—and Thylacoleo, which is not a running animal, it's an animal that depends on its prey walking by underneath it, so it can leap down on it where it's extremely efficient—but if it reduces the number of potential prey below a threshold, then Thylacoleos will starve to death.

CHRISTINE JANIS (Brown University): It's sort of like a snowball rolling uphill, if you like. The big predators are the ones who are going to feel any effects first, because they're the ones on top of the pyramid, and they're dependent on everything below them.

NARRATOR: But exactly how big a role humans played in the extinctions, alongside climatic factors, is still hotly debated, and not only in Australia, but on other continents, where a similar pattern of extinction unfolded as the Ice Age ended and humans arrived.

GIFFORD MILLER: This question is much larger than Australia, because one of the characteristics of the last 100,000 years is the disappearance of almost all the large animals almost everywhere on the planet. And the one piece of evidence that's consistently present in all extinction cases is that they occur about the same time that humans first appear on the landscape.

CHRISTINE JANIS: I think the lesson to be learned for the current day is that these big animals are very vulnerable. We think of them, because they're big and powerful and could kill us—either on purpose or by accident—as being these strong, kind of, survivors. But they're very fragile. And once they're gone, they're gone.

NARRATOR: Long after the magnificent skeleton takes its final resting place on proud display at the Western Australian Museum, research will continue on the unique role Thylacoleo played in the natural history of the outback. And the scientists who found it believe this is just the beginning of many more discoveries.

ROD WELLS: If you pause for a moment and think about Australia, what is Australia's great heritage? Australia's great heritage is its flora and its fauna, and the marsupial fauna is absolutely unique, and this is the biggest marsupial carnivore that ever lived on this continent.

JOHN LONG: I think the discovery, all out—not just the Thylacoleo but including everything we found in those caves—was a quantum leap in our knowledge of Australian megafauna of that age. Looking back on those halcyon days of the Thylacoleo expedition, it was one of the greatest times of my career as a paleontologist, certainly one of the most exciting times to be able to go out, launch an expedition go down those caves, and find these wonderful skeletons. It was just the most amazing thing. Every paleontologist dreams of something like that happening. There's still...a very big part of my heart is still with Thylacoleo and always will be.
<|endoftext|>
NARRATOR: An amateur explorer, cruising the skies of the Australian outback, makes a chance discovery, a prehistoric cave that's never been explored. Inside, something no one's ever seen before: a mysterious fossil.

ULTRALIGHT GUY (Pilot): There was one particular skeleton, and I said, "Well, it doesn't look like an old cow to me. I wonder what it is?"

NARRATOR: The strange bones are the start of an adventure. A team of researchers launch an expedition to hunt for a long lost killer, as fearsome as any top predator today.

JOHN LONG (Western Australian Museum): This is, perhaps, one of the most important Western Australian Museum field trips I'm ever going to do.

NARRATOR: On a continent full of unique animals, they're on the trail of a powerful, prehistoric lion. For years, scientists have had only fragments of the lost predator to study, and its mysteries have remained unsolved.

ROD WELLS (Flinders University): It's an animal that's full of paradoxes. There's nothing quite like it that exists anywhere else in the world. I think it would be quite a fearful animal to encounter.

NARRATOR: Now, struggling in difficult conditions, the scientists have only a short time for a breakthrough.

JOHN LONG: Time to go, guys.

NARRATOR: It's a daring search, deep below the ground...

JOHN LONG: Each time they do it, they've got to treat it like it's their life in their hands.

NARRATOR: ...and a race against the threat of fossil poachers, who could steal the precious bones.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I wouldn't come any closer, actually. In fact, a whole skeleton could be right here.

NARRATOR: The team will work for three intense weeks to rescue the remnants of a unique ancient beast.

JOHN LONG: You know, this is something that us paleontologists dream of every day.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX (Western Australian Museum): This is, perhaps, one of the most important discoveries ever made in Australia.

NARRATOR: The Australian outback: a vast, trackless wilderness filled with extraordinary creatures, including more than 200 different kinds of marsupials, which carry their babies in a pouch.

The outback is also home to one of the most ancient cultures on Earth, the aboriginal people who came to Australia about 50,000 years ago.

Their legends conjure up huge bizarre beasts, created in an ancient era called "the dreamtime" —long before the advent of humans—when heroic spirits summoned the landscape into being. The stories speak of wombats the size of buffalo, killer kangaroos, over eight feet tall. Could these aboriginal myths be a distant echo of something real?

A million or more years ago, an array of giant animals flourished here, distantly related to those on the outback today, but all of them died out toward the end of the last ice age.

In Perth, a team of Australian paleontologists are about to embark on a daring hunt for one of the lost prehistoric beasts. John Long is heading the expedition, a journey that started almost completely by chance.

JOHN LONG: I was sitting in my office, looking at the computer, and an email came through. And it was an email from someone I'd never met before. And then I saw there was an attachment. And I clicked on it, and as the attachment slowly opened, my jaw dropped.

NARRATOR: The attachment was a mysterious photo. It was taken in a newly discovered cave. It may be the find of a lifetime: the skeleton of an animal that's puzzled Australian scientists for over a hundred years.

JOHN LONG: I was totally elated and very excited. My first thoughts were that I had to mount an expedition, and we had to go and recover this remarkable fossil.

NARRATOR: Following directions that came with the email, Long and his colleagues set off on three full days of rugged driving, deep into the Australian outback.

JOHN LONG: This is, perhaps, one of the most important Western Australian Museum field trips I've ever been on, and perhaps one of the most dangerous missions I am ever going to do.

NARRATOR: They're heading to the Nullarbor Plain, more than 700 miles of almost uninhabitable land.

JOHN LONG: The Nullarbor is one of the great, vast, flat areas of Australia. It's a huge area covering several thousand square kilometers, very easy to get lost in because there just aren't any landmarks.

NARRATOR: Although it appears empty, the Nullarbor is home to many animals today, distant relatives of those enormous creatures that lived a million years ago.

JOHN LONG: There were giant goannas, the order of six meters in length. There were huge, gargantuan birds. The largest that ever walked on the planet came from Australia at this time, the dromornithids, or thunderbirds. We had a whole range of large animals, a bunch of giant kangaroos, and huge wombats the size of small cars. And at that time, it was kill or be killed. And it was pretty well cutthroat.

NARRATOR: Of all the prehistoric animals, one of the most mysterious is a marsupial lion called Thylacoleo carnifex. Very little is known about Thylacoleo. Fossil fragments have been found scattered across Australia, but never a complete skeleton. And that is what John Long thinks is pictured in the email.

At the end of a long drive, they finally make camp. For three weeks they'll live in harsh and isolated conditions.

JOHN LONG: We were about almost 2,000 kilometers from Perth and almost 900 kilometers to the nearest town. You have to bring in all your food, all your fuel, all your water, all your expertise, and then just do your work.

NARRATOR: In the middle of this desert, they'll be at the mercy of the elements. Temperatures in the daytime soar over a hundred degrees and then drop to freezing at night. And when the wind kicks up, it can literally blow the camp away. But this parched landscape was formed in a totally different environment than it is today.

JOHN LONG: Right here, where I'm standing, 20 million years ago was the bottom of the sea, limestone rock was formed. Today, the Nullarbor Plain is vast and featureless, but below ground is a different story. When ground waters rose up, percolating through that limestone rock, dissolving away calcium carbonate, the result was the formation of caves. Today there are thousands of caves throughout the Nullarbor region.

NARRATOR: Only a few of those caves are known to contain fossils. Concealing their location is critical, because there's a thriving international black market in ancient animal bones.

JOHN LONG: ...very important, because of the security of this cave, that we don't, we do not all walk in the same line.

NARRATOR: They spread out and never take the same route to the cave twice. Leaving tracks in the scrub could give away the location of the site to poachers, and priceless material could be lost to science.

It's going to be tricky just getting inside the cave. The only way down is on a harness and ropes. The scientists carefully build a scaffold at the mouth of the cave so they can lower themselves into the darkness. This will be the only safe way out if anything goes wrong.

JOHN LONG: It's about an 18-meter drop to the floor, and then the cabins go on, you know, in all directions, but for quite a way.

NARRATOR: For many members of the team, this kind of exploring is a completely new experience. They spend most of the first day at the campsite, learning to use their gear. Any mistake could be fatal.

JOHN LONG: Basically, each time they do it, they've got to treat it like it's their life in their hands.

Use your legs and keep straight.

NARRATOR: No matter how experienced the scientists are, the winds at the cave entrance can be treacherous.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: While you're on the rope or the ladder, you're often getting buffeted around, so you've got to be very careful at all times.

JOHN LONG: Use your legs.

NARRATOR: The next three weeks will be a test of endurance and patience. But it's also the chance for a unique scientific discovery.

JOHN LONG: You know this is something that us paleontologists dream of every day: a wonderful new discovery that we can then go out and collect and work on.

NARRATOR: Tomorrow the real adventure will begin.

JOHN LONG: Time to go, guys.

NARRATOR: The moment has come to descend into the dark depths of the cave.

JOHN LONG: Okay, just give Eve a "hi," and let her know you're coming down.

CAVER: Okay, Eve, I'm coming down.

NARRATOR: It's a 50-foot straight drop from the surface.

JOHN LONG: It's total, pitch black darkness, mostly totally silent. You do get a bit of wind and a bit of air diffusing through the caverns and the rocks at times, but mostly it's pretty isolated, probably about as isolated and lonely as you can get, anywhere in the world.

We dropped down, and we had to go right to the bottom of another large cavern. And then we had to crawl on our hands and knees through another narrow passageway.

This is the first time I've ever had to work in really close spaces in a cave, and it was a bit claustrophobic for me, I had to sort of adapt to it.

NARRATOR: Carefully, the team begins searching the enormous cave.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Fossils are not always draped on a nice flat surface. One has to often crawl down between the spaces between the rocks and come in from underneath to get the remainder of the bones. And sometimes the rocks are fairly precarious, so there is an element of risk.

JOHN LONG: It's a good one. Give me your hands, both hands.

NARRATOR: Piece by precious piece, they start to uncover ancient bones. Some are so fragile that just a touch could destroy them.

JOHN LONG: See, this is a major job, to get someone in here, just with a light brush, to brush away the gypsum, consolidate the bone.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Yeah, it's a beautifully preserved bone too. Now, of course, if we could find some teeth or a bit of jaw or a bit of skull, that will enable us to put a definite identification on this.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I wouldn't come any closer, actually. I think there's bone all through this area. In fact, a whole skeleton could be right here.

NARRATOR: The floor of the cave is littered with fossils.

JOHN LONG: Here we have the remains of giant kangaroos, three meters high, huge wombats the size of ponies, and, in addition to that, we've got weird species: kangaroos, wallabies, species that are quite rare and haven't been found in many other places.

NARRATOR: It looks like the cave was a prehistoric deathtrap. They find many of the bones directly under the small opening on the surface.

JOHN LONG: I can imagine that a giant wombat or a kangaroo just running along, didn't see the hole, fell straight down. Who knows? All we know is that, in terms of geological time, you only have to have one animal fall down a hole every hundred years, and over the course of several thousand years, it mounts up to a lot of skeletons.

NARRATOR: They break for the day, but there's a wealth of fossils waiting to be recovered. And they know that somewhere under this ancient soil is the big prize: the skeleton John Long saw in the email, before they left Perth.

They only have three weeks, so time is of the essence. They have to be as efficient as possible.

JOHN LONG: Yeah, I'll get the other guys—Marc and Jeff and maybe Benny—into that new chamber.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Move on to the next one.

JOHN LONG: Leave no corner of the cave unsearched...bound to be more treasures hidden there, somewhere.

NARRATOR: As they continue their hunt, they find of hundreds of bones. Many are familiar, belonging to species found at other sites. But then comes a stunning realization. This cave holds hidden treasure, unique new skeletons of extinct species, previously unknown to science.

JOHN LONG: This is the most weirdest kangaroo I've ever seen in my life, great big whacking great horns sticking out over its eyes: bloody devil wallaby.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It's certainly a new species. And I think there's an excellent chance that it's probably a new genus and species, so it's a major find...and a complete skeleton, too.

NARRATOR: Over the course of several days, they realize there's an entire community of ancient animals in the cave. They find eight new species of prehistoric kangaroo, and other lost animals that are many times bigger than their relatives today. It's an unprecedented discovery.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It's one of the most important finds ever made in the history of Australian paleontology. There's never been a cache of fossils of this age—complete skeletons scattered around the cave floor—so it's given us an excellent window into the fauna of a massive part of Australia, about which we previously knew nothing.

NARRATOR: But just as they had feared, poachers have been here. In one part of the cave, there's evidence that poachers arrived before they did and raided some of the fossils.

JOHN LONG: It hasn't taken long for the cave to start to be trashed. You've got tire marks going in there and then tracks all the way along, then you go to this cave and there's been people in there. Some of the specimens there were disarticulated. But not only that, we don't have the complete picture. When we start logging and mapping each bone by bone, some of the puzzle's missing. So it's just not good.

NARRATOR: Could the poachers have already stolen the skeleton from the email? Hours of searching pass, and then one member of the team makes a promising discovery.

EVE TAYLOR (Archeologist): I was just coming down the rock pile here, and I saw, down the slots, the larger bones of the legs. Then I came around to get a better look, and there I saw some bones.

JOHN LONG: Oh yeah, look at that. There are some big bones there that look like the leg limb bones, and also vertebrae, and a bit of hip and possibly the other lower jaw.

NARRATOR: They immediately recognize that these bones are fragments of a giant extinct lion—a tantalizing clue, but not a complete skeleton.

Then, the moment they've been hoping for. They find the bones from the email, the first complete head-to-toe skeleton of Thylacoleo carnifex ever discovered.

JOHN LONG: I will never forget that moment, as long as I live, when I first laid eyes on the Thylacoleo skeleton. There it was, in reality, not just an image on a computer screen. I was totally gobsmacked, just entirely exhilarated from the inside out. It was a complete skeleton of Australia's largest marsupial killer.

NARRATOR: Every bone is still in place. The skeleton has been resting here in the darkness for thousands of years.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: It was really quite poignant, because it was possible to tell just from, sort of, looking at the way the skeleton was laid out that that animal had taken its last breath exactly where it was lying. And you can just imagine it wandering along in the dark, dying of thirst or perhaps soft tissue injuries, collapsing, exhausted, and dying. It was quite remarkable.

NARRATOR: It's been a breakthrough day for the team. The find is a landmark in Australian paleontology. There's still a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time. They have an intense two weeks ahead of them as they face the challenge of bringing the precious skeleton to the surface.

Deep in the cave again, they begin to examine the bones more closely and there's more good news. The skeleton is untouched, lying exactly where the animal perished.

JOHN LONG: It's a pristine find. It's never been tampered with, and it gives us scientists the opportunity to go in, and not only to study the bones before we touch them, but to take samples for dating or ancient DNA. And we know there's no contamination down there, and that's very important for the science.

NARRATOR: They take samples for dating, because they want to know exactly how old the skeleton is.

JOHN LONG: It looked so well-preserved, I was thinking it might only be a few thousand years. It might be one of the youngest skeletons of megafauna yet discovered.

NARRATOR: They'll also try to recover ancient DNA from the bones, to look for clues about how Thylacoleo relates to modern species.

JOHN LONG: In modern creatures, it's easy to take a tissue sample and extract the DNA out of it. But when we look at fossils, it's often difficult to get DNA, unless you get very good preservation. Unfortunately, we didn't get any DNA out of those bones. But then the reason why became obvious when the dating results came in. The skeleton was far older than we'd ever imagined. It wasn't a few thousand years; it wasn't a few tens of thousands of years; it was probably half a million to a million years old.

NARRATOR: The skeleton's age and excellent condition make it even more valuable than the researchers had hoped, providing intimate details of the extinct lion's anatomy and behavior.

JOHN LONG: Okay, what I have here is the first-ever assembled tail of Thylacoleo, the marsupial lion. This is the only specimen known that had the tail complete. What you see is they had a long and muscular and powerful tail, the sort of tail befitting an animal that was an active predator.

NARRATOR: Before they can get the bones back to the lab, they need to prepare them carefully. One false move and the precious Thylacoleo skeleton could disintegrate before their eyes.

JOHN LONG: The skeleton was so fragile. Now, had someone actually tried to pick up the skull at that stage, it probably would have just fallen apart in their hands or fallen to dust, because it was very, very delicate.

NARRATOR: They spend days brushing on a special glue to harden the bones. It's a tedious job, but they have to do it before they can even pick up any of the bones.

JOHN LONG: After four days of painstaking work preparing the skull, today, we're finally able to pick it up and look at it in its entirety. And what we see is the powerful dentition: the big stabbing incisor at the front, this big shearing premolar. And when we look at the lower jaw, we see a similar arrangement: a powerful, stabbing incisor at the front and a shearing premolar and molar, which act like a pair of secateurs to cut through the flesh of giant three-meter kangaroos or big diprotodontine marsupials.

NARRATOR: The skull indicates that Thylacoleo's bite was incredibly powerful, equivalent to that of a modern lion, more than twice its size.

As the team continues to explore deeper into the cave, they find more specimens of the fearsome beast.

JOHN LONG: This is the eleventh Thylacoleo we've found in these caves, so far. And every specimen gives us new information that other material doesn't show. This particular animal came down in the cave and probably got wedged right here between the rocks. The head of the animal was here, and the front part of the arms fell down here.

NARRATOR: The unprecedented haul of bones poses an unexpected problem for the team. They can't possibly take all the fossils back to Perth.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Even if we took these jaws and left the rest....

NARRATOR: But if they leave anything behind, it may not be here when they come back.

JOHN LONG: There is this whole question of cave security and whether other people will get in and pinch bones and walk all over it. I'd still feel better if we at least got some of the better specimens, and we mark exactly where they came from.

GAVIN PRIDEAUX: Yeah, it's a big job. But it's a question of do you want to get the information that's available here out, or do we just want to scoop the goodies off the top and leave it at that?

JOHN LONG: These fossils haven't even been studied or described, and there's whole new species here, so the loss of knowledge, the loss of natural heritage is the main concern to me.

NARRATOR: They decide to take the eight new species of kangaroo, and several Thylacoleo specimens, including the rare intact skeleton. John Long personally tags and wraps each fragile bone for the journey back to the museum.

JOHN LONG: We numbered every single bone in the skeleton. We took loads of photographs documenting the relationship of every bone. And we very carefully hauled it up in drums on a rope to the top of the cave.

NARRATOR: But there's still one final hurdle. The difference in air pressure above and below the ground makes the wind howl through this narrow opening. One wrong move and their precious cargo could be smashed to bits against the limestone rock. Fortunately, their treasure makes the trip safely.

It's been a long, hard three weeks. But the journey of discovery will take a surprising turn as they return home to the museum to start a new exploration of Thylacoleo.

With the priceless skeleton back in Perth, John Long's colleagues from the Western Australian Museum join the investigation. In the lab, they'll be able to conduct a meticulous study of Thylacoleo, from head to toe.

JOHN LONG: Finding a complete skeleton of a marsupial lion is far more important than having hundreds and hundreds of isolated bits and pieces from different localities, because, for a start, we can build up an accurate picture of what the animal was like, and its real proportions. And we can also start to look at its functional morphology—how that animal operated as a creature. You know, how did its feeding mechanism work? How did its hands and feet work? How much movement was there in its shoulder and its backbone? And from these studies we can then start to build up a realistic idea of Thylacoleo as a living animal.

NARRATOR: Nineteenth century naturalists were the first to identify and describe Thylacoleo bones, and even with only fragments to go on, they realized how unusual a creature it was.

ROD WELLS: Sir Richard Owen described this animal back in 1859—the time Charles Darwin had just written his book on the evolution—as "the fellest of predatory beasts," and he called it Thylacoleo carnifex. Thylacis for pouch, leo for lion, carnae for meat and fex for cutting. So this was the "meat-cutting marsupial lion."

NARRATOR: But the name raised more questions than it answered. Marsupials share the characteristic feature of a pouch the females use to nurture their young. The specific bone structure needed to support a pouch in marsupials has been found in Thylacoleo skeletons.

Some marsupials live in other parts of the world, but Australia's geographic isolation contributed to the evolution of many unique species, like wombats, koalas and kangaroos. So the perplexing question is how did Thylacoleo, the extinct "meat-cutting lion," come to share features of both marsupials and big cats?

ROD WELLS: This is one of the most fascinating mammals, I think, that's ever been discovered. It's an animal that's full of paradoxes. There's nothing quite like it that exists anywhere else in the world.

NARRATOR: Rod Wells has been studying Thylacoleo most of his career. The best fossils he's had up 'til now are bits and pieces of skulls and teeth. So he starts his investigation of the new, complete skeleton with the parts he knows best, and right away he finds surprises.

ROD WELLS: This huge, single cutting tooth here, or premolar tooth, and this large premolar tooth, cutting premolar tooth, up here, are unprecedented in the mammalian world.

If we go to the front of the jaw, here, we have these two front teeth that extend here—a condition that is known as diprotodonte, Di for two, proto: front teeth, "two front teeth." And this is the condition that we find in all of the marsupials that are herbivorous. Things like possums and wombats and kangaroos and koalas all have this diprotodont condition. So here we have an animal that seems to be telling us, with one set of teeth, that it comes from a herbivore ancestry, and with another set of teeth, it's telling us it's a carnivore.

NARRATOR: Most of Thylacoleo's marsupial relatives today are plant eaters, but it seems clear that it was a hunter, like other lions.

To figure out this contradiction, the scientists have to look beyond its teeth.

MARK WALTERS (Research Scientist): I'd like a high resolution scan, one millimeter slices.

NARRATOR: Since this skull is so well preserved, it promises to deliver clues that have eluded previous researchers.

Mark Walters is a doctor who uses forensic techniques to rebuild shattered human faces and skulls. Today he's using a CT scanner for a different kind of detective work. For the first time, he will peer deep inside Thylacoleo's skull, and try to reconstruct the creature's ancient brain.

MARK WALTERS: CT data provides us with a stack of images, and we can bring those into the computer, and then we can create geometrical files. And from those geometrical files we can do a number of different types of manipulations, including taking a cast of the internal surface of the bones.

NARRATOR: The CT images are transformed into a plastic replica of the skull. Then Walters takes a set of precise measurements of the interior cavity. The final result is a remarkable three-dimensional cast of Thylacoleo's brain.

MARK WALTERS: There's a lot of information that can be derived from such a cast. We can see, quite clearly, the lumps and bumps on the bone. And they correspond to different parts of the brain. Well, the very first thing and obvious structure is that we see these very large olfactory lobes. So this animal is going to be able to detect its specific smells over very long distances. Also we can see the parts of the brain associated with sight. And we can also see the big nerves that go to the eyes. And these nerves are quite large, so you can see this animal also required a lot of good vision. So, what we can quickly see by this cast of the brain is that this animal had a very powerful sense of smell. It also had a good sense of hearing, and a very good sense of sight. So it was using all of its senses in its day to day activities.

NARRATOR: Many of today's marsupials are night creatures with keen senses of smell, sight and hearing. These are traits also shared by big cats.

With its powerful bite, Thylacoleo must have been as fearsome a predator as a lion. But the question of how it hunted is complicated by the strange configuration of its teeth.

ROD WELLS: Now, the problem with that is, of course, is how it actually catches its prey, because, in effect, these diprotodont teeth, when they mesh with the other upper incisors here, form something analogous to a parrot's beak. This animal could puncture a hole in the prey quite easily, but it would never be able to hang on to its prey.

NARRATOR: Somewhere in the new bones could be a clue to solve this problem. If Thylacoleo stabbed its victims with its large front teeth, how did it hold on to them while it finished them off?

The researchers find an answer in a part of its body they've never before been able to study in detail.

ROD WELLS: And here you will see the very large slashing claw on the thumb. So here was a mechanism whereby this animal could capture and hold its prey. So once Thylacoleo has grasped its prey, it's then in a position to deal the deathblow. And it can deal the deathblow with these sharply pointed lower incisor teeth. And of course, this would be an ideal way of doing things like severing the spinal cord, or suffocating the prey by grasping around the trachea.

NARRATOR: The evidence suggests that this ancient marsupial lion is fundamentally different from other marsupials, which lack such powerful teeth, and from other lions, which don't have its slashing claw. But without obvious parallels to these familiar predators today, its hunting habits remain a mystery.

Did Thylacoleo chase its prey? Did it hunt in packs? Or was it a stalker, laying in wait for the best moment to strike?

The scientists turn again to the new skeleton for answers. Each bone is carefully scanned so that 3D images can be manipulated on a computer screen.

MARK WALTERS: Oh, this is terribly exciting, because this animal doesn't exist. There's no other animal that exists like it. Through using this type of technology, we can reconstruct the anatomy of these animals to a detail that we've never seen before.

NARRATOR: These images help decipher how the bones were connected to each other and where muscles would have been attached. This gives the scientists a new understanding of Thylacoleo's legs and an important detail about the hunting techniques of the ancient predator.

ROD WELLS: There is nothing in the back part of the skeleton to suggest this animal was, in any way, a fast-moving animal. The hind legs are low-geared. They're powerful. And, indeed, if we look at the position where the muscle—the muscle scar—where the muscle comes off the thigh bone for rotating the thigh—about its fulcrum point here, it's attached way down here. So it's a very, very low-geared and powerful hind limb.

NARRATOR: Legs that are powerful but low to the ground mean Thylacoleo couldn't run fast for any significant distance. Chasing its prey would be out of the question; it would never have enough speed.

ROD WELLS: So I think this animal really is one that carefully stalks its prey. The speed comes with the speed with which it can slash with that forearm.

NARRATOR: As all of the new information about Thylacoleo's anatomy is falling into place, a scientific illustrator begins reconstructing its size and shape. The only things left to artistic license are the color and markings of its coat.

With the finished drawings as a guide, a scaled down model of Thylacoleo slowly takes form. Lasers scan the completed 3D model to produce digital images. And finally, the lost prehistoric predator comes back to life.

It was a fierce and stunning beast with a crushing bite and powerful legs, but it was low to the ground and heavy, not built for speed. Its feet had claws like a lion, but it walked flat like a bear. Since it was slow-moving, and probably able use its claws to climb trees, it may have ambushed its prey like some big cats today, laying in wait from above and then springing down on an unlucky victim.

And there's one final dramatic clue that seals its image as a deadly predator. The clue comes from the tail they discovered, intact, in the cave.

ROD WELLS: One of the interesting features of the tail is that...these little tiny bones here—these little v-shaped bones that are called chevrons, like on, like a roof or a chevron—and what they actually do is they protect the blood vessels that run underneath the tail at the point where the tail flexes down to the ground.

This is the sort of thing that you see in kangaroos. And kangaroos are capable of propping themselves up on the tail, tripoding, if you like, with the tail and the two hind legs. If this animal is actually catching its prey with its front legs and its slashing claw, being able to tripod back on the tail and the hind feet frees up the arm for slashing or grasping.

JOHN LONG: I have absolutely no doubt that an animal the size and bulk of Thylacoleo could have pulled down much larger animals, bigger than itself, like a giant wombat—phascolonus, the size of a small car—or giant herbivorous kangaroos. That is the sort of creature that would have been fodder for Thylacoleo.

ROD WELLS: My perceptions at this moment are of an opportunist carnivore scavenger that hunted at night, probably operated in woody shrub lands. I wouldn't want to have been a leaf-eating kangaroo with one of these guys around.

I would imagine that he operated on his own...probably sneak within very close range of the prey, and then leap at it...now either leap directly at it and grasp it with those big claws, maybe slash at it with the big claws, maybe leap onto its back and sever the spinal cord with the incisors, and then, just sit down and sheer off great lumps of flesh. I would imagine, if there were any dead animals around—this guy has got a very good sniffer—it would probably pick up the smell of carrion very easily. I think it would be quite a fearful animal to encounter.

NARRATOR: Thylacoleo ruled the Australian outback for more than a million years. Of the many large and formidable prehistoric animals, it was the deadliest, the king of beasts.

But toward the end of the Ice Age, something toppled Thylacoleo from its throne and drove it into extinction. How did this powerful killer, that could attack animals many times its size, become a victim?

CHRISTINE JANIS (Brown University): People always think that big predators are like the top of the heap, the king of beasts, the king of the jungle. And in fact, those big predators, particularly ones that sort of highly specialize in just eating meat, they're very vulnerable.

NARRATOR: Scientists are sharply divided about what caused Thylacoleo and all the other giant animals in Australia to die out. One view is that the final climax of cold conditions toward the end of the Ice Age, 30,000 years ago, pushed the great creatures into oblivion.

JOHN LONG: If you go into a maximum ice age and out of it again, in the period of 10,000 years, then you could certainly have major changes that put pressure on the environment and the animals that live in it.

NARRATOR: But a rival theory places the extinction much earlier, around 50,000 years ago. At that time, climate changes were probably less severe. And the first humans to arrive in Australia, the ancestors of today's aboriginal people, were entering the continent.

GIFFORD MILLER (University of Colorado): If we look at what was happening in Australia, 50,000 years ago or so, we can see a relatively stable climate, not that much different than today. And we also see that that's when the first humans colonized Australia. So it raises the question: could it be a human impact that's the main driver for these big extinctions?

NARRATOR: There's no way to prove that humans hunted prehistoric Australian animals aggressively enough to kill them all off, but other human activities could have helped eliminate the beasts.

GIFFORD MILLER: When humans come to Australia, we know they have fire on-demand. And so that's one of the tools people use in modifying landscapes to their benefit. And humans burn for a whole range of reasons. I mean, partly, they just burn to clear the land so that they can move across it. They hunt along the fire front, they signal distant bands, they promote the growth of plants that respond after burning. So there's many reasons why humans might be burning the landscape in a way that they thought was a positive impact.

NARRATOR: Whatever the reason, burning could have disrupted natural cycles of wildfire and re-growth, changing the vegetation and altering the habitat the giant animals depended on. Fires set by humans would narrow the range of plants to fire-resistant species. The landscape would turn to desert scrub land, and many of the browsing animals, like giant kangaroos, wouldn't have enough food to get by.

A predator like Thylacoleo, that couldn't suddenly switch its diet or hunting habits, would be highly vulnerable as its supply of prey dwindled.

GIFFORD MILLER: If the humans reduce the prey, that is, these other large browsers, on which the big carnivores are dependent—the carnivores are very sensitive to prey abundance—and Thylacoleo, which is not a running animal, it's an animal that depends on its prey walking by underneath it, so it can leap down on it where it's extremely efficient—but if it reduces the number of potential prey below a threshold, then Thylacoleos will starve to death.

CHRISTINE JANIS (Brown University): It's sort of like a snowball rolling uphill, if you like. The big predators are the ones who are going to feel any effects first, because they're the ones on top of the pyramid, and they're dependent on everything below them.

NARRATOR: But exactly how big a role humans played in the extinctions, alongside climatic factors, is still hotly debated, and not only in Australia, but on other continents, where a similar pattern of extinction unfolded as the Ice Age ended and humans arrived.

GIFFORD MILLER: This question is much larger than Australia, because one of the characteristics of the last 100,000 years is the disappearance of almost all the large animals almost everywhere on the planet. And the one piece of evidence that's consistently present in all extinction cases is that they occur about the same time that humans first appear on the landscape.

CHRISTINE JANIS: I think the lesson to be learned for the current day is that these big animals are very vulnerable. We think of them, because they're big and powerful and could kill us—either on purpose or by accident—as being these strong, kind of, survivors. But they're very fragile. And once they're gone, they're gone.

NARRATOR: Long after the magnificent skeleton takes its final resting place on proud display at the Western Australian Museum, research will continue on the unique role Thylacoleo played in the natural history of the outback. And the scientists who found it believe this is just the beginning of many more discoveries.

ROD WELLS: If you pause for a moment and think about Australia, what is Australia's great heritage? Australia's great heritage is its flora and its fauna, and the marsupial fauna is absolutely unique, and this is the biggest marsupial carnivore that ever lived on this continent.

JOHN LONG: I think the discovery, all out—not just the Thylacoleo but including everything we found in those caves—was a quantum leap in our knowledge of Australian megafauna of that age. Looking back on those halcyon days of the Thylacoleo expedition, it was one of the greatest times of my career as a paleontologist, certainly one of the most exciting times to be able to go out, launch an expedition go down those caves, and find these wonderful skeletons. It was just the most amazing thing. Every paleontologist dreams of something like that happening. There's still...a very big part of my heart is still with Thylacoleo and always will be.

NARRATOR: Crocodiles hail from the great age of reptiles well over 70 million years ago. Since then, the world has changed dramatically around them, but amazingly, they have changed little. They are the only great reptile predator to have outlived the dinosaurs. Ancient they may be, but 70 million years on, they are still the most successful freshwater predator. Most of the waterways in the tropics these days have their own species of crocodile. How come that they've been so successful for so long? Well, it seems that their design, when it first appeared, was already very advanced, and it's kept them successful ever since. This film reveals the nature of that success. Crocodiles may have scored an early evolutionary bull's eye, but there's much more to their staying power than brute strength. Only now, by exploring their complete world—above and below water, by day and night—can we fully appreciate just how sophisticated they are. Crocodiles can float or sink at will, finely tuning their buoyancy. They can control their buoyancy like a submarine. The liver is squeezed back to make more room for the expanded lungs. A crocodile can stay submerged for up to three hours. While submerged, a protective membrane closes over their eyes, like swimming goggles. Crocodiles are cold-blooded. They rely on the temperature of the sun and water to heat themselves up or to cool down. They are sluggish, but when they are warm enough, crocodiles are capable of breathtaking speed. They're the most dangerous freshwater predator on the planet. It's a status gained thanks to adaptations so sophisticated that ancient crocodile survived when their close relatives, the mighty dinosaurs, perished. It's a design that has allowed them to spread around the tropical world. This extended family includes alligators of temperate waterways, gharials of the Indian subcontinent, and caiman of tropical South America. They've even invaded the sea. Special glands in the mouth allow crocodiles to tolerate salt water long enough to reach the next river. This is how they spread along the coasts. But only a few species can migrate across oceans. The real specialists, the saltwater crocodiles, are affectionately known as "salties." They've been seen more than 600 miles from land, encrusted with barnacles, as they search for new island homes. This pioneering spirit and their unique character has made them a universal threat. Crocodiles deserve their tough reputation, but they aren't just solitary killers. In the calm of the Florida swamps, we can begin to see them in a new light. They are reptiles with social skills, and American alligators are particularly vocal. During the breeding season, an expressive chorus of bellows, grunts, and hisses rises from their dense swamps. Having settled himself into a suitable lagoon, a territorial male sets about fending off rivals. Such a perfect breeding pond is hot property. Other males put in an unwelcome bid for occupancy. The resident male only shows a bit of muscle if the rival fails to get the message. He's made his point, and he can now focus on finding a mate. Vibrations within his muscle walls send sound waves rippling out into the swamp, powerful enough to make the water dance. Part of his roar radiates at such low frequency that human ears can't hear it. But these subsonic calls have astounding penetration, travelling four times faster, and further, under the water. Only with special low frequency recordings can we appreciate what the female alligator hears. When she hears his rumbling invitation, she wastes no time, and the low frequency calls guide her through the murk and vegetation. Female alligators move freely from the territory of one male into that of another's. Even though the call may come from the remotest part of the swamp, she soon finds him. Then, things get intimate. After lengthy calling, the physical part of the courtship begins. Alligators may mate with several partners during the short summer breeding season. Crocodiles are extremely sensitive to touch. Their armor-plated toughness would appear to be only skin-deep. Such complicated language and behavior is exceptional among today's reptiles, but crocodiles might provide a tantalizing rear window on the social life of their ancient relatives, the dinosaurs. Nile crocodiles are the most fraternal crocs of all. Once a year, they hang out together, soaking up the sun at traditional mating places. Compared to Florida's noisy alligators, African Nile crocodiles are fairly quiet. These are far from being lazy afternoons. But the group is very organized, and individuals keep a careful eye on the movements of others within it. A healthy, 15-foot adult male attracts the attention of smaller females on the lookout for a fit partner. Up to ten females spend much of their time in the water soliciting him. They bare their throats as a gesture of appeasement. He'll mate with them all in turn during the breeding season. The male also uses body signals and shows off with noisy water displays. But these postures don't always keep rival males waiting in the wings. The top male flaunts to his female audience as the challenger tries to get in on the act. The rival's change of mind comes too late. Lives are rarely lost, but toes, limbs, and even tails can sometimes get ripped off. A victorious fountain of water re-asserts the top male's authority. The biggest males are usually the most successful when it comes to attracting mates. The females can also be influenced by individual temperaments. It's they who often take the lead, by rubbing themselves along the length of his body. At first, he snubs both of them, but the rubbing releases a pungent oil from glands under their jaws. Both sexes are highly sensitive to this crocodile perfume, and the male answers with his own musky message. The scent in the water is particularly potent before mating. The male will eventually court and couple with all the females in the group. But the subtleties of crocodile relationships remain submerged in mystery. Several weeks later, the females are ready to make their nests. Even when basking, adults rarely move far from water. So, it's ironic that the first and most critical part of the crocodilian life is spent on land. Crocodile babies are born encased in eggs, but they must still breathe air. It's essential that this mother lays her clutch well beyond the high water mark. The eggs will be so at risk—from drowning, from predators, and from temperature fluctuations—that she relies on exactly the same nest position year after year. These time-honored sites are a measure of the experienced care that crocodile mothers provide. Once the excavation is complete, she lays her eggs in a trance-like state. The hole will become an incubator. Crocodile eggs will only develop if they remain between a steamy 80 and 94 degrees. So, her choice of site is critical. Nest chambers from equatorial African plains to high Himalayan river valleys all remain within this temperature range. But no one knows how crocodile mothers get it right. Once the nest is sealed, the mothers keep vigil for 90 days. Temperature determines the sex of the developing eggs. A half-degree difference between the top and bottom of the next could markedly affect the ratio of males to females. No one knows yet just how disruptive global climate changes will be in terms of the sex ratio of hatchlings in the future. Right now, these youngsters face more immediate, local threats. The noise and smell coming from the nest could soon attract the attention of hungry raiders. Fortunately, there mother has been waiting nearby, and is the first to hear the muffled newborn cries. Once she digs them out, they must reach the relative security of water as quickly as possible. The babies could probably find their own way, but they're only safe if they all stick together, so their mother transports them to water herself in her mouth. The skin of her lower jaw stretches into a hanging cradle in which she can carry fifteen or so at a time. It's a snug fit—once you're in. Her 40 or so eggs hatch simultaneously, so she'll have to make several trips. The clamorings of the waiting hatchlings constantly remind her to return to the nest, and ensure that no one misses the last bus. She releases them into a nursery pool, where they must make the most of her tender loving care. They have only a few weeks under her watchful eye. Their rate of growth is affected by temperature. Over a lifetime under a tropical sun, they may grow 4,000 times bigger than this. While they're so tiny, they call to each other and to her—conversations that continue into adulthood. The 18 different sounds they'll use represent a vocabulary more typical of mammals than of reptiles. These calls can be of life-saving importance, particularly if one loses contact with the group. This hatchling's adventurous spirit is putting him in great danger, from predatory birds and monitor lizards. The rest of the family is now nearly 50 feet away. But just as their calls fade, the lost hatchling's survival instincts kick in. He utters a loud call of distress. It's answered by his siblings. The stray baby calls again. The other hatchlings reply. Their constant calls guide him back to the security of the family. Vocal contact ensured this youngster's survival. Other threats demand spirited action by their mother. One of the biggest risks is from other crocodiles. The mother successfully defends her own brood, but it's a grim reminder that crocodiles will eat just about anything. Like the adults, the young aren't fussy about food. And, like adults, they are masters of the stealthy hunting technique that all crocodiles are born with, keeping eyes, ears and nose at surface level. These shoreline snacks may be wildebeest or zebra in years to come. Growing hatchlings must eat 5% of their own weight every day. Frogs, grasshoppers, spiders, anything small enough goes. They rely on communal living to survive this tender age, but competition between the youngsters is intense. Many will be picked off by predators. Floods and droughts also take their toll. Only 2% of the hatchlings will make it to adulthood. In Venezuela, the babies of South American caiman also face tough odds. It's the dry season. Only a few pools remain. Even the fish are out of water. The dry season is five months long, but in some years, it's more severe than usual. Unexpectedly, animals can be left high, if not exactly dry. Eventually, some of these watercourses will dry up completely, leaving many caiman exposed and dehydrated. Temporary skin relief is provided by this ultimate of mud masks. Cooling water is at a premium. The remaining pools are becoming over-crowded. At such pressing times, the adults usually tolerate each other. However, babies could be eaten by them, so this is no place for a mother to raise her young. Fortunately, her babies can expect complete maternal attention during this five-month period of danger. The shrinking marsh forces their mother to make a drastic move. If she gets it wrong, the whole family will perish. Night-time cameras reveal that they will make a run for it, under the cover of dark. Their escape will be risky, for it's made over land. Mother leads the way. It's a while before the babies have the courage to join her. Calls of reassurance, and maybe her musky smell, encourage the hatchlings out of the water. She follows good instincts. Night-time temperatures are less dangerous to tiny cold-blooded bodies, and there are fewer threats about. But this is a long march that must be concluded by day-break. Their mother's acute sense of smell brings them to their watery destination, with less than an hour to spare until dawn. There's plenty of water here for her babies to survive the rest of the dry season. But there's no room for their mother. Another female has already had the same idea, and adults won't share the pool. To avoid a fight, the newly arrived mother moves on, leaving her family behind. They'll be safer in the swamp than with her. Others have done the same thing. The foster mother's creche has now swollen to more than 100 babies. Only some are hers. This mother carries her burden lightly. Crocodiles are more social than all other reptiles and grow up in company. As hunting adults, this may prepare them for dedicated teamwork—especially if there's a rare dish on the menu. Migrating zebras cross the Mara River in Kenya only a few times each year, travelling between traditional grazing grounds. Resident Nile crocodiles cannot afford to miss these fleeting chances. So, they cooperate. From different places under the riverbanks, they spend days waiting and watching the nervous herds. Only when the zebra have committed themselves to a departure point do the crocodiles take up their final positions. The current drags the zebra downstream, so five or six crocodiles cover the crossing from different angles. It's hard work for crocodiles too, but they can submerge, taking advantage of deeper, slower currents to move closer. Their approach is stealthy, measured and tactical, as if moving in on a chosen victim. The current is flowing in this zebra's favor. It buffets the crocodiles out of position and they can't get a grip. The zebra's wide rump gives it a big advantage. Adult zebras also have a vicious kick, which could break a crocodile's jaw. That might mean starvation, so crocodiles are also taking risks. A lot of effort results in little success for the crocodiles—but only until smaller, more vulnerable animals enter the water. At any time, the zebras can be ambushed by frightening power and lightening speed. The baby zebra faces several waves of attack. Crocodiles work alone, or in groups, depending on the size of the prey. This time, they were rewarded. Farther south, in Zambia, the parched Luangwa Valley is the scene of some remarkable behavior. In the dry season, it has one of the highest concentrations of crocodiles in the world. Hundreds crowd together, forced to share what little water remains. Even the hippos can't find water deep enough to wet their backs. In the heat of the day, crocodiles save their energy. There is little to do and, it seems, little to eat. But even in these extreme conditions, crocodiles excel at making the most of their circumstances. Far from being dependent on large mammals such as wildebeest or zebra, crocodiles have extraordinarily adaptable diets. We've not known this until now, because we've never seen them hunting at night. What crocodiles do at night has remained a mystery because they will only move around naturally in total darkness. So, only with the use of invisible infrared light can we see their nocturnal habits for the first time. In the Luangwa River shallows, a Nile crocodile hunts for less glamorous prey. It's stalking fish. Over the year, crocodiles fatten up on fish and mollusks, rather than mammals. Mammals come and go. But the muddy river bottom is always a good place to stir up snails, for instance. The crocodile is a flexible feeder in its methods, too. It uses its armor-plated body as sinuously as a length of fishing net to corral fish towards the shore. Midnight feasting is not uncommon at this time of year. But even the fish are running out. By day, the temperatures soar. The only ripples now are those shimmering in the scorching air. For the crocs, things appear to be getting desperate. Many animals have to resort to the scavenging habits of vultures. Even hippos, normally grazers, are forced to supplement their meager rations with the grassy stomach contents of a dead buffalo. But crocodiles still thrive on the edge. And, once again, infrared cameras allow their night habits to be discreetly filmed. Vultures have to wait until daybreak, but other scavengers and hunters are out in force. Hyenas are doing particularly well at the expense of others. Some crocs just couldn't find enough to live on. Others, though, hang onto life. But they look danger in the eye every night. Only when the dry season becomes desperate, are these two great hunters of land and water likely to come face to face. The crocodile is too hungry to be intimidated by a lion, and the smell of food wafting towards the river on the night air is just too strong. But it walks into an unlikely dinner party. A hungry hippo is formidable company. Even the lions know that. Unsure at first of its welcome, the crocodile soon takes its place at this most unusual mutually tolerant gathering. For the lions, there's no such thing as eating in peace. No sooner is the hippo out of the way than the crocodile actively takes on the whole pride. The lions, though, have had enough of the intrusion. Though lions have been known to kill crocodiles, this croc won't take the hint. There's not a lot the lions can do, especially when the smell of their supper coaxes other crocodiles out of the water. Crocodiles have thick skins. The lions are forced to defend their meal by moving to a different table. They just leave nothing but scraps behind. The reptiles have stronger stomachs than the mammals. Lions can only cope with smaller tissues. Crocodile digestive juices are so acidic that they can break down skin, bone, and horn. There's no such thing as crocodile left-overs. Their exceptional sense of smell enables them quickly to capitalize on the demise of others. And at the end of the dry season, the smell of death is everywhere. Sickness, starvation, and injury take many victims. One of this hippo's group has died. The crocodiles have good reason to be wary. A provoked adult hippo could easily inflict a mortal wound. So, they wait for it to go before closing in on the carcass. Food, any food, is hard to find. Crocodiles from up to four miles away recognize the whiff of opportunity. Each crocodile patiently waits for the chance to feed. The reason for this patient approach? Crocodiles have a powerful grip and sharp teeth, but their jaws don't move sideways. They can't chew. So, they have to eat large animals together. One or two crocodiles effectively brace the carcass in the jaws, while others wrench off smaller pieces of flesh by spinning their bodies around. The largest male usually initiates the communal meal. How the rest of the crocodiles organize themselves to feed, no one knows. It can take 24 hours to satisfy every diner. Too readily, perhaps, we have cast crocodiles as ruthless predators, feared them, misunderstood them, attacked and exploited them. But they are great survivors from an ancient line that goes back more than 70 million years. And perhaps, in millions of years to come, crocodiles will live on, successful still, looking and behaving much the same as they do today—one of the world's great survivors.

ANNOUNCER: Surviving a drought is one thing. But how about mass extinction? Why did crocodiles live when their cousins, the dinosaurs, wound up like this? Log on to NOVA's website.

NARRATOR: For those who hope to reconstruct the story of life on earth, to reveal the substance of creatures long vanished and the origin of those that live today, fossil bones are vital clues. They're unlike any other objects of scientific study. So rare, so irreplaceable, and so compelling that they're often viewed as treasure. And treasure can be a curse as well as a blessing. On May 14, 1992, the town of Hill City, South Dakota, woke up to a raid. Thirty-five Federal agents, police, and National Guardsmen surrounded a warehouse owned by Peter Larson.

PETER LARSON: I just couldn't believe what was happening. I walked outside. There was FBI agents, sheriff's officers running around with guns, and a police line all around the building. It was just—It was like a dream.

NARRATOR: Word spread that they were looking for a vicious predator named Sue. But no shots were fired. And in the end, Sue went peacefully, all ten tons. The finest specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex ever found. T. rex, the undisputed king of the dinosaurs, among the largest carnivores ever to walk the earth, is still creating an uproar 65 million years after drawing its last living breath. This T. rex, half its bones still encased in rock, is at the center of a government crackdown on modern-day prospectors, who hunt for gold in the form of fossil bones. The prime target for the better part of a decade has been the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. Over the past twenty years, Peter Larson, his brother Neal, and partner Bob Farrar, have built a thriving commercial fossil business. Yearly sales in the neighborhood of a million dollars make them the biggest players in the small world of the fossil trade. Their small museum in Hill City is a popular stop on the summer tourist trail. But their real business is collecting, preparing, and selling fossils to museums, universities, and private collectors around the world. They're known in the trade as dealers in everything from inexpensive fossil invertebrates to dinosaurs that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Larson brothers have been digging fossils since they were children growing up on the family ranch in South Dakota. But as the raid continued, they suddenly found themselves on dangerous ground.

PETER LARSON: They came through here and they—Well, for instance, they were going through our files. They came looking for photographs. This was all full of photographs. They'd pull open a drawer and they'd start rifling through and looking. "Do I want this document or do I want that document?"

NEAL LARSON: So, I tried to get their badge numbers and their names, and the one person in charge said, "You can have my badge number and my name. You do not get anybody else's name. You will take no photographs. You will take no notes." He said, "This is a serious thing." He said, "If you cooperate, everything will go fine. If you do not cooperate, we will throw you to the ground and arrest you." So we cooperated.

PETER LARSON: When the trucks drove away, people started singing the national anthem, and everybody was just crying. It was just the saddest thing that I've ever experienced. It was like a funeral. It was like Sue had died for the second time.

NARRATOR: Their troubles began during the summer of 1990, when they became acquainted with the owner of a ranch on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in South Dakota. Maurice Williams invited the Black Hills crew to look around on his property.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: I told him, I said, "You can go over there and look around sometime if you want to." And that's all I remember ever saying to him as an invitation to come.

PETER LARSON: I told him at that time that we'd be—If we did find something important, we'd be happy to pay him. We couldn't pay him much, but we would be happy to pay him for those fossils. He said no, that wouldn't be necessary.

NARRATOR: A few days later, Sue Hendrickson went exploring on the Williams ranch. At the bottom of a cliff, she discovered some interesting bone fragments, which she took back to Larson.

PETER LARSON: I'd never seen the inside of a T. rex vertebrae before, but I knew that was what I was looking at the minute I saw these things. I immediately threw down my tools and said, "Let's go!"

NARRATOR: At the cliff face, the Larson brothers saw what appeared to be the find of a lifetime: a Tyrannosaurus rex embedded in the rock.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: Sue Hendrickson called me up one evening and said that they had found this large Tyrannosaurus rex fossil in a cliff up here. "Isn't it exciting?" she said. And I said, "Well, I guess so."

NARRATOR: For the Black Hills crew, it would be hard to imagine anything more exciting. A Tyrannosaurus rex is the ultimate prize for a fossil hunter. It's been that way since the first one was discovered at the turn of the century. Christened "The Tyrant Lizard King," the forty-five-foot monster with eight-inch teeth became a huge favorite with the public and a source of continuing fascination for science. But for all its notoriety, T. rex is known from only a handful of skeletons, none more than 75% complete. So, the discovery on Maurice Williams' ranch was incredible. More than 90% complete, it was also the largest T. rex ever found, with a beautifully preserved skull. They named it Sue, after its discoverer and documented the excavation on home video. Fully prepared, this T. rex could be worth millions of dollars. But Larson told Maurice Williams they planned to make it the centerpiece of their own museum in Hill City.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: You are going to mount him in Hill City?

PETER LARSON: Yeah.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: Good. And under that, you'll say, Pete will say, "Stolen from Maurice Williams"?

NARRATOR: Larson wrote Williams a check for $5,000 and finished the excavation. Back at their place in Hill City, as they began chipping away at the rock matrix, they realized that Sue was even more impressive than they'd first thought. Unusual details such as bite wounds on the skull. A healed broken leg. And one of only two known T. rex upper arm bones added to its scientific interest. Sue clearly ranked among the finest dinosaurs ever found. So when the story of the discovery appeared in the newspaper, a number of parties took more than a casual interest. The tribal council of the Cheyenne River Sioux checked the status of Maurice Williams' ranch. They discovered that, although he owns the property, years ago, he put it in trust with the Federal government to make it exempt from property taxes, a common practice on reservation land. The tribe contended that no one could buy any part of his land, including fossils, without government permission. The tribal chairman claimed that Larson admitted knowing as much, soon after the discovery.

GREGG BOURLAND: One of the first things that Mr. Larson said, "I knew I was on a reservation. I knew I should get permission. I knew a lot of things that I should have done, but I didn't do them because we found this world's greatest T. rex. We came, we saw, we dug, and we ran."

PETER LARSON: There were no permits to get. The tribe did not have a permitting system. Since this is private land, there is no permitting system from the Federal government that was necessary to get. We had the necessary permission of the landowner. We did not need permission from the tribe.

NARRATOR: And did he ever admit guilt, as Gregg Bourland claimed?

PETER LARSON: No, I never made that statement.

NARRATOR: But the tribal council disagreed and drafted a resolution asking the U.S. Attorney to help them get the dinosaur back.

GREGG BOURLAND: Quite simply put, Sue belongs to the people of this reservation. Mr. Williams entered into a bogus or an illegal deal with the Institute, a deal that is currently under Federal investigation. Mr. Williams and the Institute thereby both forfeit any rights to the T. rex.

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Maurice Williams asked the U.S. Attorney to help him get the dinosaur back, denying that he never sold it to Larson in the first place.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: Well, I'm assuming he got that idea from that check that he wrote. But there was no mention of any sale between he and I of anything.

PETER LARSON: We agreed on a price of $5,000 for the fossil and the rights thereof, and we wrote him a check, and he took the check and cashed it.

MAURICE WILLIAMS: I'm assuming it's worth a whole lot more than $5,000.

PETER LARSON: It's something that turns out to be so wonderful that everybody wants it.

NARRATOR: So, almost two years later, the U.S. Attorney for South Dakota ordered the dinosaur seized and began a criminal investigation of the Black Hills Institute.

PETER LARSON: I'm going to fight this thing until fifty years after I'm dead, if I have to. The government's wrong. The government is not correct in what they've done here.

NARRATOR: Fossil hunting, and fossil wars, have been part of the North American experience ever since white settlers began carving up the land west of the Mississippi in the 19th century. Discoveries of fantastic skeletons created a sensation. The big eastern museums hired fossil hunters to stake claims and dig up the bones. Competition was intense, and not always friendly. Dig sites were often armed camps. Back east, museums prepared the specimens for display. But eventually, the dinosaur halls were full. Collection efforts were scaled back, and then virtually wiped out by the Great Depression. But in the 1970s, dinosaurs came roaring back. With new discoveries, their image changed from lumbering reptiles to active, possibly warm-blooded animals. Now, they're an industry in themselves, and an early interest in science for children around the world. People everywhere want dinosaurs. But robotic theme parks, like this one near Tokyo, aren't enough to satisfy true dinosaur lovers. Unfortunately, fossils of the real thing are harder to come by. Dinosaurs lived all over the world, from the Arctic to the South Pole, but good-quality skeletons are extremely rare. None have been found in Japan, and few in Europe. But they are found in North America. So, museum buyers from around the world join the crowd at huge fossil shows each year in Tucson and Denver.

DEALER: Want me to spin it for you? Perfect sutures!

NARRATOR: Most countries have strict laws governing the export of fossils. But America is wide open, and the foreign buyers know it.

THEO HENSKENS: In America there are not so very much rules. It's a free country and you can buy here what you want.

NARRATOR: The Black Hills Institute is just one of many dealers selling North American fossils to a broad range of customers. At the low end of the market are buyers from educational supply houses, schools, and gift shops, looking for common, inexpensive fossils. Further up the scale are national retailers and high-end fossil shops catering to private collectors and decorators. And at the top end are international museum buyers looking for impressive and rare display pieces. But not everyone is happy about the booming fossil trade, least of all, professional paleontologists like Robert Hunt, of the University of Nebraska.

ROBERT HUNT: I become saddened by what I see at many commercial fossil shows, particularly the shows in Tucson and in Denver. You do see vertebrate fossils that are scientifically significant, fossils that will probably be only found in maybe a century, on display and for sale to the highest bidder. Many times, those fossils, when they're sold at those meetings, are never seen again. And we all know that there's a tremendous loss of information.

NARRATOR: A big concern among paleontologists like Jack Horner is that commercial collectors don't always take the time to preserve the context of the fossils they find, the small clues that give fossils meaning.

JACK HORNER: The kinds of data that we are now collecting to see what dinosaurs were like as living animals and what their paleoecology was like and their environments were like, includes collecting not just dinosaurs, but everything else. And if people just go in and, you know, are just taking the pretty stuff out, that, that ruins what we're trying to do.

NARRATOR: In the summer of 1990, while the Black Hills Institute was excavating Sue in South Dakota, Jack Horner's crew was busy excavating another T. rex two hundred miles away in Montana. Working slowly and carefully to preserve all the information at the site, Horner's dig took ten people five weeks to complete. It took six people from the Black Hills Institute less than three weeks to get Sue out of the ground.

PETER LARSON: We collect very carefully, but we have to do our job in a way in which we can support ourselves, and we can't afford to waste time taking years to excavate specimens. We have to do it in a way that is expeditious.

NARRATOR: Kirby Siber is one of the biggest fossil dealers in Europe, and a longtime friend and business associate of Peter Larson. Here, at a private quarry in Wyoming, he's excavating a young apatasaur for his own museum in Switzerland. He thinks many good commercial collectors are unfairly blamed for the actions of a few.

KIRBY SIBER: The people that are lumped into the so-called "commercial collectors," that's a very diverse group. And that goes from the people that on weekends go on their four wheelers and drive out and just pick up scrap dinosaur bones to people like us who do, you know—Probably there's very few crews in the world that have so much digging experience like us.

NARRATOR: Siber admits, though, that science and commerce sometimes require different approaches.

KIRBY SIBER: Our primary aim is to dig for displayable fossils, for museum display-grade fossils. If our primary goal was studying certain aspects of petrification, dinosaur bone structure, or whatever, we would probably dig slightly different. But that's why it's good that there are many different groups digging. Each one will have a slightly different approach. I believe in diversity.

NARRATOR: European commercial collectors are used to a more cooperative relationship with paleontologists, and Siber insists on quality documentation.

KIRBY SIBER: It just makes plain sense to do it this way. When we do things, we like to do them right. It really preserves, enhances the value of the specimen. The better you have it documented, you know, the better your product is in the end. The comparison must be made fairly. Compare the best of commercial collecting with the best of scientific collecting.

JACK HORNER: You can have commercial collectors that, that are very scrupulous, that are collecting data at their own site. They're not messing with anyone. They're keeping good records. They do the preparation. They mount specimens. They sell them somewhere, some museum. And it's all accessible. There's nothing wrong with that. But if I'm out collecting somewhere, and someone comes out and digs up a dinosaur that I've got half out of the ground, that's irritating. That's more than irritating.

ROBERT HUNT: We have had sites in Nebraska that were actively excavated by our university, invaded by commercial businesses, and we have lost material and lost vital information because of that.

JACK HORNER: Fossils have been literally bought out from under, underneath the scientists. I mean, someone comes in and just makes a new deal with private landowners.

NARRATOR: That's what happened to David Weishampel of Johns Hopkins University. After three years of work at a site on private land, he arrived one summer to find that he was no longer welcome. He blames the change on the arrival of commercial collectors in the area.

DAVID WEISHAMPEL: What they were doing was offering people money for the opportunity for them to go out and prospect and collect. And within a year, land owners were demanding to be paid for permission to come out and work these sites again, and in fact, I wasn't able to return to them.

NARRATOR: Like most scientists, Weishampel has neither the budget nor the inclination to compete with commercial collectors.

DAVID WEISHAMPEL: I don't think that everything, every physical object, really demands that it have a price tag put on it. Why can't we respect fossils for what they are? They're parcels of the history of life. Why should that be treated as something that can be bought and sold?

KIRBY SIBER: Some people, some of the academia, they have this hangup about prices. They think that you shouldn't put the price on a fossil. It's immoral to put the price on a fossil. But, let's face it. Everything has, in a way, has its price. The Americans are the ones that surely know that everything has a price! And so, even a fossil. Why not put a price on a fossil? It represents work; it represents a rarity. I mean, this price can be determined like some price of—Why are there academics that say, "We don't want to put the price on it. Never, ever! It's immoral!" This, I don't understand.

NARRATOR: Most American museums cannot afford to buy top end dinosaurs from commercial dealers. With a few exceptions, they use their own staff paleontologists to collect new specimens. But foreign museums are a different story. Especially in Japan, where many new museums are in development, paying the high cost of commercially collected fossils is the quickest way to build new collections from scratch. Even so, commercial collectors who work without institutional support claim selling fossils is no way to get rich.

PETER LARSON: It's a tremendous output of money that goes into the digging, the excavation, the cleaning, preparation, and mounting of that dinosaur. One of our dinosaurs takes 15,000 hours to prepare. There is not one commercial fossil dealer that has gotten rich ever. If you can find one, I'd sure like to know who he is and maybe I could sell him some stuff.

NARRATOR: In the year following the seizure, the Black Hills Institute wages an all-out war to "Free Sue." They run an aggressive public relations campaign out of their Hill City office.

MARION ZENKER: A fifty-piece mailing has to go out to the AAPS members and it's all got to be packed and ready to go by Friday night.

NEAL LARSON: We get in here every day hundreds of people who say, "You got to get Sue back. You got to keep up what you're doing." And that gives us strength.

CUSTOMER: Free Sue! It's the one with Sue coming out of the jail.

NARRATOR: Every visitor to the gift shop gets a crash course in fossil politics. Through it all is a constant theme of abuse of power by the government.

PETER LARSON: People are paying attention to what goes on here. And they're not going to be able to do the type of thing that they have been able to do in other cases and it just goes away. It's not going to go away here. We're never going to quit this fight.

NARRATOR: Their attorneys file a civil suit against the government, demanding the return of Sue. And the dinosaur sits in a warehouse in Rapid City while the custody battle rages on. Public protests mounted by the Institute get louder and more abrasive. U.S. attorney Kevin Schieffer is singled out for special abuse. The attack is relentless and sometimes ugly.

KEVIN SCHIEFFER: Well, it's not a pleasant situation in any event, but we do what we have to do.

NARRATOR: Schieffer doesn't have much to say in public, but behind the scenes, he's turned up the heat on the criminal investigation of the Institute. In January, 1993, Federal prosecutors subpoena thousands of BHI business records.

NEAL LARSON: Field notes and everything else. Photo albums. Every piece of work we've ever done that we liked and we took pictures of, and pictures that people have sent us. It's all here. It's all gone.

NARRATOR: Investigators sift through the seized records looking for evidence of crimes, specifically, of taking fossils from Federal land. The western states are checkerboards of private and public land—national parks, Forest Service, BLM, and parts of Indian reservations. It's often arid, eroded country passed up by homesteaders in the 1800s. But that same quality makes it a rich source of fossils as new specimens weather out of the ground. It's long been government policy to deny access to commercial collectors. Collecting without a permit amounts to theft of government property, though the law has rarely been enforced. Former park ranger Vince Santucci has spent years documenting cases of fossil poaching in national parks.

VINCE SANTUCCI: People were getting either a slap on the wrist or no penalties at all. It incensed me in a personal way that, boy, fossils don't receive the respect they deserve. You know, if this was an archaeological site or if somebody shot a buffalo, my gosh, the SWAT team would be out. But because we're talking about fossils at that time, people just didn't really have the energy and the enthusiasm to correct this problem.

NARRATOR: But now, there's energy and enthusiasm to spare. Using field notes seized from the Black Hills Institute, investigators begin searching for illegal excavation sites on Federal land.

ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY, ROBERT MANDEL: It was a surprisingly difficult thing to do. I guess if you didn't think about it, you'd think, 'What's there to it?' But we had to prove where particular specimens came from, establish that that was, in fact, government land, that there wasn't any permission given for taking those fossils. In fact, their field notes were very good, and that's how we determined that a number of them did come off Federal lands.

NARRATOR: At each site, they also search for evidence that would tie BHI employees to the location. As the investigation grows, dozens of agents follow leads all over the west and as far away as Japan and South America. In July, 1993, the FBI returns to Hill City, armed with a search warrant.

PETER LARSON: They came into this office, locked the door, and they were in there with the computers apparently copying everything from our computer onto their computer.

MARION ZENKER: Everything, all of our financial files, our. . .

NEAL LARSON: They took unopened mail, they opened mail, they did all kinds of. . .

PETER LARSON: They took, they took things such as the confidential client file from our attorney in there. It didn't matter what; if they thought they had a use for it, they took it.

PATRICK DUFFY: The Department of the Interior, of course, has been involved. BLM, Bureau of Land Management, has been involved. Forest Service has been involved. It would probably be hard, from the Pentagon all the way to Smokey the Bear, to find anybody who hasn't been involved in this case at one point or another.

PETER LARSON: Apparently, they're investigating our entire lives. Certainly back at least as far 1974 when we stared this business, with the allegation of multi-state criminal activity. These allegations are all unfounded.

NARRATOR: 144,000 acres of South Dakota's Badlands National Park overlap the Pine Ridge reservation of the Oglala Sioux. The tribe is responsible for enforcing park regulations on this part of the reservation. Terry Roy is the chief ranger for tribal land. He spends a lot of time chasing fossil poachers.

TERRY ROY: We have close to 5,000 square miles to cover with only like seven rangers, enforcement rangers, to do the task, and it's an extremely difficult task, to say the least.

RANGER: Yo, J.R.! We got somebody down there. From your left, just go straight down. He's just bending over now, picking something up.

NARRATOR: Most of the time, poachers in this part of the park are local people.

TERRY ROY: The violators know the Badlands in this area probably better than we do. They practically live out here. From sunup to sundown just about every day, they're spending out here. They know all the tricks of the trade. They know where to hide, where not to hide. They know our routines. They monitor our radio frequencies. They know our maps, they know our sectors, our patrol schedules, everything. It's sort of a game of intelligence.

RANGER: I'll keep an eye on him.

TERRY ROY: Just because we are able to see them, doesn't mean we're going to get them. There's quite the route between us and them, even if we have visual contact.

RANGER: Junior, it looks like he's still digging down there. Just go ahead and keep going down slow. He's spotted you now, Junior.

NARRATOR: It's common knowledge among the rangers that local poachers are working for dealers off the reservation.

TERRY ROY: It's bounty hunting. They would specify what sort of items they were looking for. They want complete skulls. They want the best possible specimen that they can find within the Badlands. Once they actually go through that process and see how much money's involved, they're pretty much. . . They're hooked; got them hook, line, and sinker.

NARRATOR: The Pine Ridge reservation has the lowest per capita income of any county in the United States. Unemployment is 80%. Calvin Ferguson has a part-time job as a bus driver, but until recently, he was doing much better as a fossil hunter.

CALVIN FERGUSON: Most money I ever made on a fossil is about $2,500. It was on a cat skull. I wasn't hurting nobody. Just out makin' money. It's something I always loved to do, too. It was just like, every day it was different. It was like going treasure hunting every day. Sometimes, it would take you a week to make five hundred dollars, or it'd take you one day to make five hundred dollars. All depends on how your day went, how lucky you was.

NARRATOR: Over the years, the buyers showed the local people how to make a living in the fossil trade.

CALVIN FERGUSON: They were there with the money, and we learned a lot from them, too. Told us where the good zones were to hunt that might make the most money and the quickest money.

NARRATOR: Federal investigators suspect that some of those fossils were finding their way to the Black Hills Institute. But when the rangers started cracking down on the poachers, the buyers got scarce.

CALVIN FERGUSON: It seems like right about when that Sue thing started going on about that T. rex, then that's when the Park Service started going too, on the reservation. And that's when the white guys got scared and didn't want to come down and get caught.

NARRATOR: The fossil trade can be a mixed blessing for Native Americans.

TERRY ROY: We have a great respect for the land. Our culture pretty much dictates that. There's a lot of traditional people that would see any exploitation of the resources being wrong, regardless of the economic need. But, a person like Calvin and other people, it's understandable. We're not looking to prosecute, convict, anybody on this level, because, in my opinion, they're the ones that's being taken advantage of. Them and the resources.

CALVIN FERGUSON: I think we should do it in the right way, like issuing out permits to the tribal members. What the Park Service here on the reservation is trying to do is make it legal for tribal members and giving out permits, but it'd be best to give out permits to the ones that have been doing it for a while and know what they're doing instead of amateurs.

NARRATOR: In the meantime, Calvin drives the bus and looks forward to being a legitimate collector someday, a change that would not only provide some local employment, but would also help deter the most serious threat posed to paleontology by the fossil black market: illegal traders attempting to cover their tracks.

ROBERT HUNT: If fossils are collected illegally, if data is not accurate, if specimens are reported to come from Wyoming, but in fact, they really come from Montana, the raw material of science, the hard data that we need to reconstruct environments of the past, evolution and so forth, we can't trust that data, and once we can't trust the data, we can't trust the science that comes from that data.

NARRATOR: In November, 1993, a Federal grand jury in Rapid City returns a thirty-nine count indictment, charging the Black Hills Institute partners with fifteen instances of fossil theft from public land, and a long list of white collar crimes, like conspiracy and wire fraud, arising from the sale of those fossils. Around the same time, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals rules that the Institute has no legal claim to the T. rex called Sue.

PATRICK DUFFY: Bad news. Let's shut the door and I'll talk to you about it. I'll tell you about how the opinion went down.

NARRATOR: The partners gather at lawyer Patrick Duffy's office to hear the details.

PATRICK DUFFY: Well, Maurice Williams owns Sue. The United States of America holds Sue in trust for Maurice Williams. To put it simply, it's his dinosaur now. Petition for Cert to the United States Supreme Court would be the next step, and depending on whether it's granted or denied, that would determine how much longer this is going to go on.

NARRATOR: This is also bad news for the Cheyenne River Sioux, who have lost their claim to the T. rex as well.

GREGG BOURLAND: We have a long-standing history of getting screwed by some unscrupulous type folks around the country, including other governments, so we're pretty much used to this kind of stuff.

PETER LARSON: With what's happened throughout this, it's almost as if. . . You think of the Mummy's Curse. It's the Curse of Sue, that everybody who is touched by this is in some way harmed.

NARRATOR: On December 10th, 1993, the Black Hills defendants report to the Federal Court House to plead not guilty to all counts of the criminal indictment. There are no charges relating to the T. rex, but the defendants contend they are being targeted because of Sue.

PATRICK DUFFY: This indictment, thirty-nine counts worth, exists in the form it does to punish my clients for having spoken out against an absolutely punitive raid by the Federal government. Had they never spoken, I'm confident, had they never spoken out, had they never taken their case to the street, so to speak, we wouldn't be sitting here today.

NARRATOR: The prosecutors, who've been working the case for more than three years, deny that there's any retribution involved, despite the anti-government rhetoric of the "Save Sue" campaign.

ROBERT MANDEL: Something you have to understand is that this case went through three U.S. Attorneys. And even if you wanted to believe that one person might have had some personal animosity, it kind of stretches the imagination a bit to think that three U.S. Attorneys in a row would have the same personal vendetta against some defendants. And that's just not true. That's not what drove the case.

ROBERT MANDEL: The United States holds the dinosaur Sue in trust for Maurice Williams, but that does not have bearing on the criminal case that we were just talking about.

NARRATOR: The prosecutors have little to say to the press. They've spent millions of dollars building their case and don't want it jeopardized with pre-trial publicity. It's been expensive for the defendants as well, who have run up legal bills over a hundred thousand dollars. That night, they gather at Peter Larson's house to watch the news.

TV NEWS: Christmas won't be coming early for the Black Hills Institute, following a ruling from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals that Sue, the Tyrannosaurus rex, belongs to the Federal government, not the Institute. The ruling couldn't come at a worse time for the Institute as employees appear in court to face thirty-nine counts of illegally taking other fossils from the government.

NARRATOR: For the first time ever in the United States, people are facing serious jail time for fossil crimes.

TV NEWS: The defendants headed to Federal Court this morning to face a total of thirty-nine counts, charges that include conspiracy, theft of government property, interstate transportation of stolen goods, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. If convicted, the defendants face fines of up to $500,000 and up to ten years in prison.

PETER LARSON: Up to ten years in prison?

NARRATOR: In fact, they each face more than three hundred years in prison and twelve million dollars in fines. But the harsh penalties are not for the fossil thefts, which are minor offenses under current law. It's the white collar crimes that could send them to prison. Many people feel there should be tougher laws to protect fossils in the first place.

VINCE SANTUCCI: The fact is that the laws currently say that it's illegal to take them, OK? There's a permitting system that's set up to protect those fossils. The thing is that people are going ahead and taking them anyways.

MARK GOODWIN: What is it? A $50 fine now for collecting fossils on public lands? I mean, that's a slap on the wrist. It's worth the risk to a commercial collector. They can get a quarter of a million dollars, a half a million dollars, $800,000 for a good dinosaur skeleton.

NARRATOR: To the dismay of most scientists, in the current political climate of deregulation, Congress is more likely to open up Federal land to commercial collecting than to toughen laws against it.

MARK GOODWIN: I don't like to see paleontology politicized. I didn't want to enter the maze of Washington, D.C., contact my Congressman, and start lobbying for further protection of fossils. But I don't see any choice.

NARRATOR: Most commercial collectors argue that Federal land should be opened up, without restriction, for the good of the fossils.

PETER LARSON: Because there's millions and millions of square miles in this country that are sedimentary rock that are filled with fossils. Every time it rains, there's new fossils washing out. Every time it rains, there's new fossils washing away that will never be seen again. Fossils, in order to be preserved, must be collected. The best way to ensure the preservation of fossils is to collect them and to get as many people out there looking for these fossils as possible.

MARK GOODWIN: I would argue that letting everybody out on public land, without any type of review, overview, permitting process, you wouldn't have any fossils left.

JACK HORNER: When it comes to Federal land, we will fight. We will do our best to preserve our right to collect there without them. Because, it's our only, it's our only place left. If the commercial collectors get into that as well and can compete with us, at that level, I'd say the science is going to be close to doomed.

NARRATOR: Whatever changes lie ahead in fossil law will come too late for the Black Hills Institute defendants, who finally go to trial more than a year after their indictment.

PATRICK DUFFY: By all estimates, it's going to be one of the longest criminal trials in the history of the midwest. The record alone will fill dozens of volumes. Then you'll have the appeals. The idea of getting through a trial of that length and magnitude with absolutely not one mistake being made is, at best, unlikely. Will we have to try it again? Who knows?

PETER LARSON: They have spent so much money. They need to have a picture on the ten o'clock news of me being put in handcuffs and being put in a car and being hauled off to prison in order to justify the expense of that taxpayers' money. They need that.

NARRATOR: After seven weeks of testimony, scores of witnesses, and the presentation of hundreds of pieces of evidence, the case goes to the jury, and the defendants go home to wait. Three weeks later, the jury returns its verdict. They find Peter Larson guilty of two felonies for failure to report carrying currency over $10,000 in and out of the country, and two misdemeanors for theft of government property worth less than $100. Bob Farrar, guilty of two felonies for undervaluing fossils on export declarations. Neal Larson, guilty of one misdemeanor for theft of government property worth less than $100. And for the Institute, one felony for retaining a fossil fish stolen from Badlands National Park, three felony customs violations, and one misdemeanor for theft of government property. The jury votes to acquit on seventy-three other charges, and is hung on sixty-eight. Despite felony convictions, the defense claims victory.

TV REPORTER: Any comments on the verdict today?

PATRICK DUFFY: None, other than sheer delight.

TV REPORTER: Why is that?

PATRICK DUFFY: Well, we ended up with how many? You guys know better than I do. How many misdemeanors? Four or five? And how many felonies? Three or four? So, we're probably talking about maybe the most expensive misdemeanors in the history of the Republic.

TV REPORTER: What's the cigar? Is this a victory cigar?

PATRICK DUFFY: You got that right. See ya, guys.

NARRATOR: Cleared of the most serious charges, but still facing the possibility of prison time when sentence is passed, the Black Hills partners once again go home to wait. The message to the fossil trade is clear: Until further notice, public land is off limits. Now, the question is, can science and commerce find ways to co-exist? In at least one case, they already have. Here on the Blackfeet reservation in Northern Montana. Jack Horner worked here for years before a company called Canada Fossils approached the tribe with a business proposition. They would pay tribal members to dig dinosaurs and prepare the bones, and pay the tribe a royalty on sales. But first, they had to contend with Jack.

DON DUBRAY: The Blackfeet tribe has made arrangements with Jack Horner for a long time. So, when Canada Fossils came in, we were kind of a little bit reluctant to just turn it over to a commercial company and put Jack out. So, they went down and they met and they made a kind of a deal.

JACK HORNER: When they find something that they think is unusual, they bring it to my attention. And I think that's good. If it's unusual enough, they just turn it over. And I think that's sort of the right thing to do. I mean, it's sort of, it's the commercial collectors attempting to keep peace with the professionals.

RENÉ VANDERVELD: I'm not sure that he was particularly keen on seeing us arrive, but I think that over the five years that we've been working together, he has understood that we can help him.

NARRATOR: So, Horner keeps an eye on the fossils coming out of the ground and makes sure that nothing important is lost to science. And Canada Fossils brings its resources to the preservation of material that might otherwise be lost to erosion. In a field with barely enough institutional support to begin with, a cooperative venture like this one can help everyone involved, including the landowner, in this case, the Blackfeet, who have seen a lot of valuable fossils leave their reservation over the past hundred years.

DON DUBRAY: Until we made a deal with Canada Fossils, the Indians never got a thing, nothing, out of these fossils. So, I think they really belong to us and we should decide what we're going to do with them.

NARRATOR: Dorothy Flamand works for Canada Fossils as a digger and a preparator. She's been collecting dinosaur bones since she was a little girl.

DOROTHY FLAMAND: My grandmother didn't think too much of it. She told me that was a burial ground and to leave it alone. She said it was big people. She told me to bring the bones back where they come from. So, I had to bring them back. I like to be out there exploring and finding dinosaurs and new species. That's just like getting a present every day, when you uncover a bone when you don't know what it is. But I sure wouldn't want to find a T. rex. They fight too much over them.

In February, 1996, Peter Larson began serving a two-year sentence in Federal Prison.

Neal Larson received two years probation.

The convictions against Bob Farrar were thrown out.

Sue is scheduled to go on the auction block at Sotheby's in April 1997.

Maurice Williams is looking for a million dollar bid.

NARRATOR: Welcome to the future. PBS Digital

NARRATOR: When you're spending a million dollars on a 30-second commercial, you want your leading man to have just the right look.

MELISSA HANSEN: We're not looking for Schwarzenegger; we're looking for Mel Gibson, or you know, Harrison Ford.

BOB SULLIVAN: Harrison Ford, Harrison Ford would be really who we're looking for.

MELISSA HANSEN: Yeah, somebody who...someone who had a little glimmer of mischief in his eyes, you know, a spirit behind it.

BOB SULLIVAN: Well, and sex appeal, because sex sells.

MELISSA HANSEN: Sex appeal is so important.

NARRATOR: But what if the script says your leading man is a dog? Is this the right look? Or is it this? Or this? Fact is, dogs come in more shapes and sizes than any other mammal on the planet, and there's no shortage of opinions about what's sexy in a dog.

But this commercial is designed to sell fabric deodorizer, and it calls for a sexy "everydog" kind of dog, which is why Dino got the job.

MELISSA HANSEN: Dino has this incredible presence—that sort of everyday quality, that sort of down-to-earthness. He came across in the first casting tape. It was great. It didn't hurt that Dino's more than just a pretty face. He's the kind of performer who's willing to do his own stunts.

BOB SULLIVAN: We were thinking we were going to have to do computer animation, and we were going to have to do all kinds of techniques. And within a week, all of a sudden the director calls us and he goes, "I can't believe it, the dog can spray the bottle."

TRAINER: Foot! Foot! One more time. Foot! Good.

DIRECTOR: That's a cut, that's a cut.

TRAINER: Foot! No. Stay! Foot!

NARRATOR: Not bad for a dog who was abandoned and brought to the Las Vegas pound. That's where his trainers found him five years ago.

TRAINER: Down! Good boy.

Now he's a star.

NARRATOR: In many ways, the Levines are a typical American family, always on the run. Perhaps life would be better, some of them believe, if only they had...

LILY MIRELS LEVINE: ...dog, we need a dog.

AARON LEVINE: A dog would be great!

ELI LEVINE: I want a really big dog!

MIKE LEVINE (Geneticist, University of California at Berkeley): A dog, in our family, it's crazy.

LILY MIRELS LEVINE: I think it's a really good thing to grow up knowing what it's like to have a pet.

MIKE LEVINE:	I just don't particularly like dogs. They've always struck me as being rather big, smelly...they shed all over the place.

LILY MIRELS LEVINE: He never had a dog when he was a kid, and truth be told, I think he's a little afraid of them.

MIKE LEVINE:	Personally, I'm more of a bug guy. I like flies, butterflies, things like that.

NARRATOR: Little creatures can help a geneticist like Mike Levine explore life's mysteries, but he's never been able to understand the passion that people have for their big, messy, demanding canine companions.

JOE VERGNETTI: They're kind of like your children. You're proud of them, and you try to make them perfect and trim them and have them look beautiful.

MAN WITH ROTTWEILER: He is so smart, he is so obedient.

MAN WITH BULLDOG: He's a beautiful, beautiful dog.

WOMAN WITH BASSET: The best thing in the world is to come home and have somebody happy that you're there.

MAN WITH ROTTWEILER: I'd marry this dog if it was a woman.

OFF CAMERA VOICE: What is it that a dog does for you?

MAN WITH LITTLE DOG: Well...a lot more than my wife.

MIKE LEVINE: I've held out now for, I would say...10 years there's been talk of dogs. And finally the time has come where I have to relent and allow a dog in.

NARRATOR: Which is why Mike recently found himself checking out potential new family members. And while he doesn't fall in love, he is unexpectedly intrigued.

MIKE LEVINE:	There is one cool thing about dogs, I have to reluctantly admit, and it is all the varieties: different shapes, different sizes, different colors. It's an extreme example of evolutionary diversification.

NARRATOR: The Levines come home with a little mixed breed dog named Taxi. Fulfilling every one of Mike's expectations, Taxi's first day includes throwing up in the living room, peeing in the kitchen, and shedding hair everywhere. All of which, the boys and Lily get over quickly. It's not so easy for Mike. He's trying hard, but a month into this grand experiment, Taxi remains for him less a beloved companion than an example of a fascinating evolutionary mystery.

MIKE LEVINE:	All dogs arose from a fairly homogeneous population of wolves, something on the order of 10,000 years ago. And that is just a fascinating scientific problem. How did this one population of animals that all look more or less alike, give rise to this incredible diversity of dogs in a relatively short period of time?

NARRATOR: Wolves are one of nature's elite predators. They hunt with a rare mix of endurance, speed, ferocity and teamwork. Yet these skilled killers were the first animal to be domesticated. The mystery is: how? Some say humans made it happen. If so, it's a good bet it wasn't by taming adult wolves. But a baby wolf, that's another matter. They're pretty irresistible.

JAMES SERPELL (University of Pennsylvania): We have abundant evidence from anthropological accounts, ethnographic accounts, of hunter-gatherers in different parts of the world, capturing and taming young wild animals and then bringing them home and keeping them as pets.

NARRATOR: Perhaps our ancient ancestors did the same: finding a wolf pup, falling in love with it, and bringing it home to raise as a pet, essentially adopting it. And perhaps they keep at it, even though the majority of pups grow into unpredictable and dangerous adults or simply run away.

JAMES SERPELL: We have to picture maybe thousands of these pet wolves going through this process and sooner or later when you do this with thousands, you're going to get some which grow up to be more amenable to living in that context and less of a threat.

NARRATOR: If so, early humans might have ended up with a wolf like this. Her name's Maya, and she lives at Wolf Park, a research facility and tourist attraction in Indiana. Here, staff biologists have turned raising tame wolves into a science.

WOLF PARK STAFFER: I actually thought about going in and turning around and trying to come out, but I'm too claustrophobic to be in there that long.

NARRATOR: Their process begins with a midday raid on a den filled with 10-day-old pups. They've found that the first step in raising tame wolves is to take them from their mothers at a very early age. For the next four months, these puppies are with people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's tricky: do the wrong thing and you can wind up with a grown wolf that's unpredictable and dangerous.

PATRICIA GOODMAN (Wolf Park): We spend about 2,000 human hours in a summer—that's not all one human—socializing these puppies to us. It's an extremely labor intensive process and we're always monitoring each other's behavior, because it's extremely easy to reinforce the wrong kind of behavior before you've even realized you've done it.

NARRATOR: All this care produces wolves that aren't threatened by human smells and sounds. Even so, everyone at Wolf Park moves carefully when they're with the wolves. Sudden and unexpected gestures can provoke a serious bite. These animals are only superficially tame; they certainly aren't dogs.

But they could be a first step on the journey to dog. The next step would be to allow only the tamest wolves in the pack to breed. If you kept that up generation after generation, in theory, you would create an animal fundamentally different from these wolves, one with tameness in its genes.

According to some biologists that's essentially how the dog was first created 15,000 or more years ago. Others think the idea you can get a dog by adopting a wolf is nonsense.

RAY COPPINGER (Hampshire College): The idea that Stone Age people could tame and then train and then domesticate a dog is just ludicrous, as far as I'm concerned. When I think of how much time it takes to train a dog, and think that those people back there, who had their own problems, and they've got to spend weeks, months, training wolves, and the wolves are going to put up with this kind of thing, and they're going to do it generation after generation, and I'm going to breed my wolf with your wolf? I mean, wolves have very strict rules about who they breed with, and when they breed, and so on. I mean, I don't see Stone Age people sitting out there with chain link fences and all the things that are required for me to breed dogs. They just don't have the stuff to do it with.

NARRATOR: For Ray Coppinger and other dog experts who reject the adoption hypothesis, the challenge has been to find an alternative. How else might the journey from wolf to sled dog—and all the other diverse forms dogs take—have begun?

It was only when he started thinking about what was in it for the wolves that Coppinger came up with an answer. Now he's convinced wolves chose domestication, and they did so because of the easy pickings in a Stone Age equivalent of this Tijuana dump.

In a dump, an animal that's a little tamer, a little less likely to get scared off by people, has a better chance of finding food and surviving. It's true today and, Coppinger argues, it would have been just as true a long time ago.

RAY COPPINGER: Imagine 14,000 years ago when people first get the idea of living in a village. They settle down, they build permanent houses, and around that permanent...those permanent houses, all the waste products of their economies build up. You've got waste food; you've got waste materials of all kinds. Now there's a whole set of animals that move in on that. We know them now: we've got house mice, we've got cockroaches, we've got pigeons, we've got all kinds of animals that are living off the human waste. One of them is the wolf. The wolf moves into that kind of a, of a setting, that new niche, that new foraging area, and it's great. You don't have to chase anything, you don't have to kill anything. You just wait; people dump it in front of you.

NARRATOR: Not every animal can take advantage of this resource. Most wild animals run away when humans approach. The few that don't, have a real advantage. They're going to get most of the food, and that means their offspring are more likely to survive. Each new generation becomes increasingly tame.

RAY COPPINGER: The ones that run away the first time anybody shows up, those are the ones that are going to be selected against, they're going to go out, have to make an honest living out in the wild. They're not going to be able to get enough out of that dump. So here's natural selection in action. Any one wolf that's a little tamer than the other, who can stay there longer, get more food, he's the one that's going to win that evolutionary battle.

NARRATOR: That's how natural selection works. It's a classic, if somewhat unexpected, example of survival of the fittest. It's also, according to Coppinger, the best way to explain many of the physical differences between dogs and wolves.

RAY COPPINGER: You look at a wolf's mouth, and he's big and he's got these robust teeth, and you can see him out there killing things. The dog has little teeth. The wolf has a big brain; the dog's got a little tiny brain. Well, who in the world has little tiny brains? Animals that don't need brains. And the dog, you know, a scavenger, doesn't need much of a brain. I mean it doesn't take a lot of cunning to figure out where a rotten tomato is. You basically have to be there when somebody throws the tomato away. So you're kind of a sit and wait animal.

NARRATOR: Was it the lure of our leftovers that ushered in the era of animal domestication, or was it a matter of puppy love? Either way, what's critical is that tamer than average individuals somehow gain an advantage and become more likely to breed.

Of course, that leaves unanswered another problem. Many dogs have floppy ears, tails that turn up and curl, patchy coats of many colors. These aren't things you see on wolves, which makes sense because none of them would help a wolf survive in the wild. It's been suggested that humans consciously bred for these traits. Ray Coppinger thinks that's more nonsense.

RAY COPPINGER: What do you do? Do you start selecting for a tail? You know—each generation of tail is going up inch by inch until it gets to the top. And while the tail is going up the ears are coming down centimeter by centimeter until they're floppy ears, you know, and so on. From a genetic point of view, I've got to have a mechanism, I've got to have something there, and believe it or not, for forever it's been a mystery.

NARRATOR: Traits like coat color, or the way a dog carries its ears or tail, are determined by its genes. Genes are pieces of DNA, and they often come in subtly different versions. Every dog gets one copy of every gene from mom and one from dad. These genes can be mixed and matched in countless ways, but if the parents don't have it, the pup can't get it.

And that's what makes curly tails and patchy coats in dogs so mysterious. Wolves don't have them. It took a remarkable experiment in a most unlikely place, to solve this mystery. The place was the middle of nowhere, Siberia. And the experimenter was an out-of-favor Russian geneticist named Dmitri Belyaev.

Local fox farmers had asked Belyaev for help in breeding a less vicious animal. Belyaev began with the tamest foxes he could find. From their offspring, and for many generations thereafter, he chose only the tamest for breeding. He'd expected that each new generation would be a little less vicious, a little more tame. But by the tenth generation, he was seeing things he'd never expected.

RAY COPPINGER: All of a sudden his fox ears started down, his fox tails started up, they started to bark, which is not characteristic of foxes. They started to have different coats, all these little features that you can't imagine being in the wild type. I mean it's not a matter of selecting for, because they're not there to be selected for—that variation isn't there.

NARRATOR: What does tameness have to do with ears, and barking and coat color? Belyaev and his colleagues immediately went looking for an explanation. They checked the foxes' adrenaline levels—that's the hormone that controls the "fight or flight" response—and they found they were far lower than normal.

RAY COPPINGER: That would explain the tameness, they're just not afraid because they're not producing as much adrenaline. But where does the multi-colored coat come from? And somebody says right off the bat, "Hey, adrenaline's on a biochemical pathway that also goes to melanin, also has something to do with the animal's coat color." So there's a correlation between coat color now and the adrenal gland.

NARRATOR: Suddenly, it all started to make sense. As Belyaev bred his foxes for tameness, over the generations their bodies began producing different levels of a whole range of hormones. These hormones, in turn, set off a cascade of changes that somehow triggered a surprising degree of genetic variation.

JAMES SERPELL: Just the simple act of selecting for tameness destabilized the genetic make up of these animals in such a way that all sorts of stuff that you would never normally see in a wild population suddenly appeared.

NARRATOR: Most dog biologists now believe something very similar to what happened to these foxes also happened to a population of wolves more than 10,000 years ago. And the rest, as they say, is history: the world's first domestic animal.

And from the beginning, dogs have been a remarkably good fit in human society, thanks in large part to the social skills they inherited from wolves.

JAMES SERPELL: The key thing, I think, was that dogs are pre-adapted to living in fairly complicated social groups. Wolf society typically has quite well-established dominance hierarchies within it. Individuals learn to slot themselves into that hierarchy and function within that context.

NARRATOR: Low-ranking wolves are adept at sucking up to their more powerful pack mates. Dogs use many of those same skills with people.

JAMES SERPELL: So we're getting these signals from our dogs that we are important, we're loved, we're the greatest thing around. And you know, to me, it's obvious why we like dogs—because they're so good at showing that they like us.

NARRATOR: This intimate bond between humans and dogs goes back a long way—according to one controversial theory, a very long way.

Jennifer Leonard is part of a team at UCLA that studies ancient DNA. She's come to London's Natural History Museum to collect some really old dog bones which she hopes will help prove the team's radical new theory.

CURATOR (Natural History Museum): These are some domestic dog remains. They date to the pre-pottery Neolithic period.

NARRATOR: Even a tiny slice of six thousand-year old dog tooth contains DNA, and DNA is a window into the ancient origins of the dog.

Back in Los Angeles, Leonard sequences the different chemicals of the dog's DNA.

These As, Ts, Cs, and Gs come from a small segment of DNA where mutations—spontaneous changes in the genetic code—harmlessly accumulate over generations.

NARRATOR: To geneticists, these changes are the ticking of a crude kind of clock. Leonard's tests and earlier experiments show that clock has been ticking for dogs for a long, long time.

ROBERT WAYNE (University of California, Los Angeles): I was amazed. And, principally, I was amazed because of the depth of divergence in different dogs. It was nothing like you'd expect among a group of animals that had diverged very recently—12- or 14,000 years. The sequences were dramatically different.

NARRATOR: This theory suggests that dogs started accumulating these mutations 100,000 years ago, back when Neanderthals and Homo sapiens were still duking it out for survival.

This has inspired some pretty far-fetched speculation, like the idea it was dogs that tipped the evolutionary balance in favor of us and the notion that dogs gave us a reason to invent language.

In truth, if there were dogs 100,000 years ago, they were probably far more wolf than dog. But by 10,000 years ago, just about everywhere there were people there were dogs that looked and acted like dogs. Back then, dogs came in a pretty standard size and shape. There's no evidence of dogs like this or this. Or even this.

But by 5,000 years ago, it's clear dogs are no longer "one size fits all." This shape has survived in dogs like the Saluki, and Salukis are the Porsches of the dog world. In a three-mile race they can outrun any mammal on the planet.

ELAINE JOHNSTON (Saluki Breeder): I think the Saluki is an amazing creature. There's such grace and such power, and such flowing movement and lines. There's just nothing like it. I mean it just makes my heart sing.

NARRATOR: Today, Salukis are an unusual breed, just as they were thousands of years ago in Egypt when these creatures were the play toys of Pharaoh's court.

ELAINE JOHNSTON: I must say that I've never thought of myself as a little mid-Eastern princess watching her Saluki course across the sands, but Saluki in full stride—it's the next best thing.

NARRATOR: The Saluki is an engineering marvel. Its long legs mean it can cover almost 10 feet in a single stride. Its tiny waist allows it to tuck those legs way up when running—twice in every stride all four feet are off the ground.

Its heart and lungs are oversized to maximize oxygen intake. Its chest is narrow to help control heat build-up. Even its long nose helps by cooling the blood. From a design perspective, Salukis are remarkable. But that doesn't stop Saluki lovers from trying to breed in a little extra.

ELAINE JOHNSTON: I think that his neck is a little bit too short. He's got great strength in the neck, but I'd like to have it just a smidgen longer. I also would like to have a little more muscle definition in the rear.

NARRATOR: Human intervention in animal breeding is so common today, it's widely assumed we've been doing it forever. But 6,000 years ago, no one knew about oxygen uptake and cooling the blood, which is why most biologists scoff at the idea that this sophisticated running machine was intentionally bred.

So how did Salukis evolve? Although we may not have bred them, people are a big part of the story. Dogs have always done things we find useful, and we've always rewarded the ones that are the best.

Eight thousand years ago, large stretches of the Middle East were open grassland where small game was abundant and regularly preyed on by hungry humans. But more often than not, the rabbits were fast enough to send the humans home empty-handed. Then, one day, a bunch of dogs tagged along on a hunt. Being dogs, they joined the chase. One of them was faster than the rest, and caught a rabbit. His master rewarded him with food. A better-fed dog has a better chance of surviving, attracting a mate, and passing on its genes.

Repeat this process for enough generations and you end up with a sleek, highly sophisticated racing machine—no assembly required.

RAY COPPINGER:	Nobody had to know about a long nose or long legs. All they had to do was take the dog out there in the desert and have it chase rabbits. Over the generations of just picking the best dog, the one that can see the rabbits best, the one that can catch the rabbits, what they do is, they get longer legs. They didn't breed for longer legs, they just favored those dogs that had them.

NARRATOR: It's the glory of evolution run fast-forward. Humans set the conditions for success, reward those animals in each generation that do the job best, and nature does the rest. That same basic process produced big, aggressive guardian and war dogs, and small, quick vermin hunters like the early ancestors of these ratters.

Through our long history together, whenever we've moved to a new environment or given dogs a new job, we've ended up with very different looking animals. Yet, remarkably, as different as two dogs may appear, they're still very much the same genetically, still capable of breeding.

So how can dogs be so different and yet remain genetically so much the same? Mike Levine thinks the key may lie in stretches of DNA that, until recently, were dismissed as meaningless.

Only part of the DNA in every cell actually codes for proteins, the building blocks of life. The rest is a mystery. Some stretches probably are meaningless. But many geneticists now believe that buried in these mysterious stretches of DNA are critical instructions for turning genes on and off.

MIKE LEVINE: Turns out that there are two parts to the gene. There's the famous part, which encodes proteins. Then there's the less-appreciated part, where I think the real action is, and this is in the so-called "regulatory" DNA. It tells the protein coding part of the gene where and when to be active. It is the software of the genome.

NARRATOR: According to Levine, subtle changes in this software could produce remarkable diversity and do it without changing the DNA that makes a dog a dog. All these dogs could have the same genes for leg growth, the only difference may be in when those genes are turned on and off. The frustration for geneticists like Mike Levine is that, so far, they haven't been able to crack the code of the regulatory DNA.

MIKE LEVINE: We know the DNA exists, we know that the cis-regulatory DNA controls in detail where genes are turned on and off, both in development and in evolution, but we just don't have a handle on the language of that DNA. It's sort of like discovering the Dead Sea scrolls and not knowing Hebrew. We need to find a language to decipher the meaning of the cis-regulatory DNA if we're ever going to understand the functions of complex genomes such as dog genomes and human genomes.

NARRATOR: Even without being able to read the regulatory DNA, scientists are convinced of its importance in determining an animal's physical shape. But what about inherited behaviors, like the unquenchable desire some dogs have to retrieve? Could they, too, be influenced by when genes are turned on and off?

It's certainly a part of how biologists explain Charlie's behavior. He has, to say the least, a very different reaction to sheep than his wolf cousins. Sheep, to a wolf, are dinner on the hoof. To Charlie, sheep are comrades to protect from nasty predators like wolves.

It's a bond he formed early in life. When Charlie was a puppy he went through a stage of life when he was especially open to new experiences. It's called the "critical period of socialization."

RAY COPPINGER: All animals, all vertebrates, anyway, have this critical period, where the animal learns what species it belongs to. Birds, they have a critical period where they learn the species' specific song. If you don't learn the song, then you can't go out there and sing the song and get a mate. So they have to learn it. And they can only learn it in this one little window of time. Now, dogs' critical period for social development is probably about the first 16 weeks.

NARRATOR: At that point, a signal from the genes closes this critical social window. In wolves, that signal comes when they're about three weeks old, which means dogs have five times as long to form social bonds.

RAY COPPINGER: If a dog grows up in its critical period of socialization in a flock of sheep, then it can socialize with sheep. If it grows up in a flock of people, it socializes with people. It's very malleable in that kind of way.

NARRATOR: When genes are turned on and off may also determine why some breeds are so much better at characteristic activities like herding, tracking and retrieving. All of these have their roots in the instinctive way a wolf hunts. Every predator hunts in basically the same way. It starts with "search," which turns into "eye-stalk" when a potential meal is found. Once close enough, "chase" begins. "Grab-bite" brings dinner down, and "kill-bite" finishes the job.

RAY COPPINGER: A wolf, once he starts into the sequence, he's got to go all the way to the end. So he goes from the searching to the eye-stalk to the chase, and you can't say, "Look, all right boy, easy, easy, easy—don't go there," because for the wolf it's appetitive; at the other end of it is a dead sheep.

NARRATOR: But dogs get their food from people. Even hunting dogs like this pointer don't need to hunt for a steady meal. That means there's no downside if the genetic signal for an instinct like stalk or chase is exaggerated, weakened, or even turned off completely.

RAY COPPINGER: All right, so if I go to the pointer, I have him searching, he goes into the eye, but I don't care about stalk. I don't want him to chase, chase is a fault. I don't want him chasing the bird out of there.

If you look at, say, a retriever—I don't care about eye-stalk in a retriever. I really want the orientation. I want them searching for something, and when I find it, I want them to go right to grab-bite. So those two stages in the middle, bango, I don't want those. I just want them to go right to grab-bite.

Do I want kill-bite? No. And when I get kill-bite in a retriever...that's called "hard mouth." He stops and eats it, you know? Every retriever man's worst scenario of all of a sudden the dog stops and eats the bird.

NARRATOR: Tracking, pointing, retrieving, herding, many of the behaviors we most value in dogs today, are simply aspects of what a wolf does to survive. Give a dog a job, say, to follow a scent, reward the ones that do it best, and over thousands of generations a distinct behavior will evolve. The result is the most diverse mammal on earth. There's more than 400 different dog breeds and more than 400 million dogs. That's thousands of times more dogs than wolves. In evolutionary terms, the dog is a real winner.

And some dogs have hit the jackpot, like the lucky few who are regulars at this Manhattan doggy day care center. Here they can hang with friends, swim in the pool, enjoy biscuits on demand and the attentions of a personal stylist. They even take field trips.

GABRIEL (Dog care provider): Sometimes we have...we take the dogs to Southampton. We're going to have a cruise at the end of November.

NARRATOR: Once primarily working animals, dogs today are mostly pets. They're frequently chosen more for what they look like than what they can do or how they behave. But a preoccupation with appearance is not without consequences. All purebred dogs are products of intensive breeding, and every year more and more of them suffer from an ever-growing list of genetic diseases.

Interestingly, the disease problem and the dog's elevated place in our lives can both be traced to Victorian England. A growing middle class, looking for ways to show they've arrived, mimic the rich by bringing into their homes unproductive animals.

HARRIET RITVO (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): So, by the middle of the 19th century, it was not only ordinary, but highly desirable for a prosperous, respectable, bourgeois to have a dog or several dogs, and also several cats.

NARRATOR: These animals are badges of wealth, a declaration that the owner is rich enough to keep and feed an idle pet. Like lavishly appointed homes, dogs are status symbols. But as more and more people can afford them, some way has to be found to anoint a few with the mantle of aristocracy. So the dog show is born, a competition that's soon restricted to purebred animals. And since few if any of these dogs herd or hunt, their quality is judged solely on appearance.

JAMES SERPELL: And that's when you get bizarre and somewhat eccentric groups of middle class people focusing their lives on breeding perfect animals in particular breeds.

NARRATOR: In this world, ideas about status, competition, and the importance of parentage and bloodlines quickly become inextricably combined.

JAMES SERPELL: The idea of pure blood and breeding pure strains of things coincided, of course, with a lot of racist talk about refining the purity of human groups and races. And the breed literature from this early period, some of it is unashamedly eugenicist and racist.

NARRATOR: And the legacy endures: a preoccupation with bloodlines and appearance. In the show ring, only purebred dogs are allowed to compete, and they're judged on how closely they match a written description of perfection, called the breed "standard."

CHARLOTTE McGOWAN (Papilon Breeder): The standard is the blueprint for the breed. In this particular breed, the ears are very important: they're set at a 45-degree angle to the head, just like Allesandro's ears. They're round, like this, and they're fringed. The skull end is two-thirds, the muzzle is one-third, the stop is defined, the nose is tapered, the eyes are round. These are all elements that go into making a perfect papilon.

NARRATOR: Charlotte McGowan has been showing dogs since she was eleven.

CHARLOTTE McGOWAN: I'm hoping that I'll still be doing this when I'm 90, that's why the dogs are getting smaller and smaller.

NARRATOR: Of the ten papilons that live with her, all the adults have earned the right to be called champion, and the puppies will soon. What's more, she's convinced she's only begun to tap the greatness in this gene pool.

CHARLOTTE McGOWAN: We really enjoy the ability to take the gene pool and use it like paints. It's our art. This is my art. I made this beautiful dog that I enjoy. I made her—I chose her sire and her dam, I chose several generations to make this beautiful dog. I'm very proud of her.

NARRATOR: Like most champion show dogs, Bibi is the product of inbreeding. Her offspring will be too.

CHARLOTTE McGOWAN: Her mother was bred to her mother's grandson to produce her. And when I choose a mate for her, I'm going to choose her grandfather who was also her great grandfather. The reason I do the close breeding is that I have something very good. I want to keep what I have and I want to improve it. And by closing down the number of potential genes I'm going to improve my chances of doing that.

NARRATOR: Inbreeding is the only way to finely control what the next generation will look like, but it comes with a well-documented downside. Here's why.

Sometimes a gene that helps produce something good, say the shape of a dog's ears, is located on a dog's DNA close to another gene that produces something bad, like a disease. When that happens, there's a good chance any pup getting the good gene will also get the bad one.

Now, as long as the pup gets a healthy version of the gene from the other parent, he should be all right. But inbred dogs have a much greater chance of getting the same bad gene from both parents.

So far, Charlotte McGowan has been able to avoid the pitfalls of inbreeding her papilons. But hundreds of thousands of other purebred dogs are suffering from genetic diseases.

RAY COPPINGER: The time has come where we've just got to give up this kind of "master race" mentality that we have about dogs. Our system of breeding dogs, of isolating small populations called breeds and then practicing eugenics, generation after generation after generation, all of those dogs are inbred beyond belief. It's not good genetics and it's not good dog breeding.

NARRATOR: Determined not to give up all they've created, the dog breeding community has turned to science. If scientists can develop genetic tests to identify those dogs with bad genes, breeders believe they can do the rest.

CHARLOTTE McGOWAN: When they find the markers, we can basically select away from the disease. We can breed, continue to breed beautiful animals, and we can get rid of the disease.

NARRATOR: If only it were that simple. Only a few bad genes have been identified, and even then it's uncertain whether enough breeders will make the sacrifices required to weed them out.

In the meantime, scientists like Karen Overall believe there's a lot these inbred dogs can teach us about the links between genes and behavior. She's studying dogs born with a debilitating shyness. Confronted with anything unfamiliar these dogs freeze. Overall believes they offer a rare window into the genetic basis of fear and panic.

KAREN OVERALL (University of Pennsylvania): Hello. Look here. This is one of the affected, what have been called nervous, pointers. Notice how frozen this dog is. Normally these dogs would come up and do things with you. I mean, you can...they get so frozen you can actually just move them around. And he'll stay in this position. This is for...Dogs who are anxious and withdraw from people are just like a lot of schizophrenic and autistic humans who withdraw from people and can't interact.

And by understanding the dogs, we have this absolutely marvelous opportunity to investigate the neurochemistry and the genetics of what goes on in these people and to suggest treatment.

NARRATOR: Proton scans, a fancy form of MRI, provide Overall with information on the dog's brain activity and structure. It's her hope she'll discover levels of certain brain chemicals that correlate with this intense shyness. In this case, having an inbred extended family is a good thing.

KAREN OVERALL: With these dogs, we've got brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and grandparents and nieces and aunts and cousins, and we can look at that whole thing, and you can look at the whole disease complex as a unit. You can look at the behavior, you can look at the neuroanatomy, you can look at the neurochemistry, you can look at the molecular basis of the receptors, and you can look at the ultimate genetics. And we can't do that with people.

NARRATOR: Because the genes of dogs and humans are so similar, other scientists are using dogs to discover clues to some of the most vexing of human genetic diseases. With the help of Dobermans like Blitzen and Donner, and a dachshund named Beau, Emmanuel Mignot has already made a discovery that could improve millions of human lives. Beau has narcolepsy. At moments of high emotion, he loses muscle control and appears to fall asleep. Good canned food is enough to bring on an attack. On the rare occasions when Beau slips off into the hall, everyone knows there's no reason to race after him.

Narcolepsy is far more common in people than it is in dogs. But it's easier to study in inbred dogs because they have so much less genetic variation. Not that it was easy.

EMMANEUL MIGNOT (Stanford University): The process of finding the gene was a very, very long ordeal. And I have to say, I amazed myself with my patience. Even so, at the end, you know, we were so tired, and we couldn't believe we'd finally get the gene.

We discovered something that may have clinical application for narcoleptic patients, and that is a dream for a researcher. You know, we worked, we looked hard for this gene, but we would not have dreamed that what we found could have been useful quickly. And I think there is a good chance that new medication will come out, directly from that research, for human patients. And that's really a plus.

NARRATOR: It's another example of how dogs help us.

But how much have we helped them? Sometimes the behaviors we've bred into dogs aren't well suited to the lives we ask them to lead.

Jennifer and Troy Dow love their Siberian Husky, Emerson, but he's almost impossible to live with. So they've come to the University of Pennsylvania's animal behavior clinic. Their hope is that Karen Overall can help them change his behavior. If she can't, they face the painful prospect of having Emerson euthanized. Five million dogs a year in the U.S. suffer that fate, most often because of a behavioral problem.

Most problem dogs, according to Overall, aren't really sick. It's just that the behaviors bred into them are a poor match for the life they're asked to lead.

KAREN OVERALL: What most people want in a pet is something that doesn't shed, that barks a bit but not a lot, that tires easily so that they don't have to keep up with it, that perhaps maybe even doesn't see or hear so well because then they're not going to react to lots of things.

Look at a Dalmatian or a vizsla—easy-groom dogs, so everybody thinks, "great apartment dogs." People don't have any time to groom the dog? Get a Dalmatian or a vizsla. I've almost never heard of anything so crazy in my life, because these are dogs that can go 35, 50 miles a day and never get tired. That's not a great apartment dog.

What we have are breeds that were bred for behaviors that might be incompatible with being a good pet. Very few of us actually use them to round up our stock anymore. When herding doesn't have an outlet, or when herding goes bad, what does it become? It becomes a dog that has to control everything in its environment, including you.

RAY COPPINGER: You know, if you want a dog to be a good companion, breed it to be a good companion, breed it to be a good pet. Why do you have to have your pet have this kind of historic representation of a sled dog, you know? What does it do for you? It enhances your image as, "I'm a, one of those rough and tough guys that can go out there and mush my way to the North Pole. And you know, because I have a Siberian husky, that's kind of representative of what I would like to be." And so you're using the dog in order to, you know, project a certain kind of image. No, that's not what you want. You wanted a good companion, you wanted a pet, you know? The boy and his dog image, that's what you're looking for, you know? Breed for it. Breed for it.

JAMES SERPELL: Sometimes I fantasize about somebody in the dog world coming forward and saying, "Well, let's forget completely about what these dogs look like, and let's just focus on their behavior. Let's breed the perfect social companion; let's breed the perfect pet."

I think everybody would win in the long run. Dogs would certainly win because you would have animals that would be more suitable for living with people in the modern world, and would be, therefore, less likely to be rejected or discarded. And people would certainly win because they would have an animal that gave them the most enjoyment and pleasure.

NARRATOR: It's six months now since Taxi came to live with the Levines, and most of them have grown to love him.

LILY MIRELS LEVINE: I could imagine leaving my shoes around and not having them chewed. I can imagine driving my car around and not having it barfed in. I could imagine a life without a dog, but it's nicer with. And I think Aaron actually said it the best. 'Cause after we'd had him for a few weeks—and it was a little, really, rough at the beginning—I was grumbling, and he said, "But our family is so much jollier with Taxi here." And it's true.

NARRATOR: Even Mike admits having a dog is sometimes "kind of nice."

MIKE LEVINE:	When he's happy, you know, you see the glow in the eye, that little tail starts, you know, taking off like a quick propeller, jumps up on you. And, really, after a long day in the lab, dealing with a lot of competitive personalities, having this creature greet you in a very straightforward and honest fashion is really sort of uplifting, I have to say.

NARRATOR: The Levines are determined to do the best they can by Taxi. Given the long strange journey dogs have made with us, do any of them deserve less?

Some dogs have not only been our best friends but our most valued helpers, sniffing for termites, aiding arson investigations, searching for land mines and more.

NARRATOR: In the warm waters of San Diego, a team of marine biologists sets out on a routine dive. They're surveying the native eelgrass in this coastal lagoon.

In the beginning, everything seemed normal in this ocean paradise, where surfers ride the waves, and the lagoons are perfect for water sports. But below the surface trouble was brewing. The dive team moved slowly along the bottom. It was hard to see in the murky water. Then suddenly, they came face to face with an alien monster.

RACHEL WOODFIELD: You could just tell as you came up to it, there was trouble. It has a real insidious sort of creepy nature, as if it's some sort of blob that's taking over at the bottom.

GREIG PETERS (California Regional Water Quality Control): It's like out of a horror movie, but it's real.

NARRATOR: This is the alien, a seaweed called Caulerpa taxifolia. All seaweeds are algae, but this one is extraordinary. Caulerpa taxifolia is perhaps the largest single-celled organism in the world. One plant can grow nine feet long, and it spreads uncontrollably, turning lush marine landscapes like this into acres of green weed, an Astroturf®-like carpet and nothing more.

It was a scientific horror story. California had been invaded by a super algae that could overtake the Pacific Coast, and no one knew how to stop it.

But one man, 6,000 miles away, was all too familiar with this green monster. French seaweed expert, Alexandre Meinesz, had confronted Caulerpa taxifolia before. He found a patch of it a dozen years ago in the Mediterranean Sea and immediately sounded an alarm, but nobody listened.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ (University of Nice, Sophia Antipolis): The authorities didn't want to know about the problem. We lost precious time when the algae could have been contained or maybe even eradicated.

NARRATOR: Today, about 40,000 acres of Mediterranean coastline is clogged with Caulerpa, and many scientists believe this beautiful sea is lost. Is America next? What can be done to stop this Deep Sea Invasion? Up next on NOVA.

NARRATOR: This is Caulerpa taxifolia, a seaweed. And it's the most threatening underwater plant on earth. It can grow anywhere, at the astounding rate of one inch a day, pushing out everything in its path. Getting rid of it, if that's even possible, would require an all-out war, a biological battle between a weed and the scientists who understand the danger.

When Caulerpa taxifolia was discovered in San Diego, no one here had ever seen it before.

RACHEL WOODFIELD: We all knew when we saw it that it definitely wasn't something native. When I finally found a photo and the picture downloaded onto my computer, there was just a sinking feeling in my stomach.

NARRATOR: Within days, the infested lagoon was cordoned off like a crime scene, banned from human use and guarded by the police. Everyone now realized what could happen if they didn't act fast.

ROBERT HOFFMAN (National Marine Fisheries Service): We're assuming the worst case scenario: that if we don't control it, it's going to completely overtake this lagoon. And if we're wrong, I'd rather be wrong, over estimating the impact than underestimating it.

NARRATOR: The impact of alien species has been underestimated before. Africanized bees have killed more than a thousand people from Brazil to the United States, and now they threaten the American honey industry. With no natural predators, European gypsy moths have destroyed oak forests from Maine to the mid-west.

Today, thousands of alien plant, animal and insect species have invaded this country, costing hundreds of millions of dollars to control. But this seaweed may pose the worst threat of all.

Caulerpa taxifolia has already reshaped the Mediterranean Sea, mainly because no one listened to the one man who recognized the threat back in 1989. It all began here off the coast of Monaco.

One day, French marine biologist Alexandre Meinesz went diving in the Mediterranean. Meinesz is an expert on the marine life of the Mediterranean. He knew that among the dozens of plants that live here, one is fundamental to the sea's ecosystem. It normally covers large areas of the seabed. It's a dark, gray-green sea grass called "possidonia." Possidonia is a plant that provides food and shelter for a huge variety of fish and other sea creatures.

But that day, as Alexandre Meinesz dived, nothing was as he expected it to be.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: The water was very clear, the sun was shining, and visibility was good, and I saw straight away that the seabed was bright green. I said to myself, "This isn't possible. There shouldn't be any brilliant green seaweed here."

NARRATOR: Where Meinesz had expected to find the usual variety of Mediterranean sea life, all he could see for hundreds of yards was a dense, bright green mat of weed he'd never seen before. Everything was smothered in it.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I went deeper, to the bottom. It was still there. Then I went to the west and to the east, and it was still there as well. I was really astonished at the size and extent of the algae. It struck me as being supernatural.

NARRATOR: As he studied the extraordinary new plant, he realized it was a giant variant of a tropical seaweed, or algae, called Caulerpa taxifolia. Yet how could a tropical plant survive in the colder waters of the Mediterranean?

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I didn't understand how such a vigorous tropical algae could withstand the cold and survive—and not just that, could spread. That was something extraordinary.

NARRATOR: He decided to find out what was going on. Back in the laboratory, he compared Caulerpa taxifolia with other specimens of the same family from around the world.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I have a few specimens that I collected myself several decades ago in the Red Sea, and here is Tahiti, in Polynesia. They are all small, whatever depth they come from—not very long, not very wide and the runners are always very thin. So I realized straightaway that what was growing in the Mediterranean was something absolutely exceptional that had never been seen before.

NARRATOR: This new plant was bigger, tougher and more vigorous than any other specimen of Caulerpa, and it normally lived thousands of miles away in the tropics.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: It's a giant in comparison with what can be found in tropical seas. I realized that it was different from anything else in the world. I was absolutely astonished. It was something strange. I did some more research, but everything confirmed my first impression. It was an alien. Something abnormal, supernatural, was beginning to develop in the Mediterranean.

NARRATOR: It was growing so fast and dense that it was swamping the dark green native possidonia. There was something else, too. The coastal waters of the Mediterranean are normally home to some 600 species of animals and plants. Yet the seabed around the mysterious new algae was almost devoid of other marine life.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I immediately felt that the whole Mediterranean was in danger. This was a very adaptable plant. It seemed able to alter the ecology of large areas of the sea.

NARRATOR: It seemed like something out of science fiction. What was a gigantic tropical algae doing flourishing in the temperate waters of the Mediterranean?

Yet on the surface, life went on as normal. Meinesz tried to raise an alarm, but no one was interested. He realized he needed better scientific evidence that the algae was damaging the sea's marine life. He took his concerns to a colleague along the coast in Marseilles. Charles-Francois Boudouresque is one of France's leading experts on Mediterranean underwater life.

CHARLES-FRANCOIS BOUDOURESQUE (University of the Mediterranean): Alexandre Meinesz telephoned me several times to say he'd made an incredible discovery. He asked me to come to Nice to see it. I said, "Yes, yes, but later." It took him a year to persuade me to come and see the colonies of Caulerpa taxifolia.

NARRATOR: When he saw it, Boudouresque was also shocked by the invasion. He immediately agreed to investigate whether the algae was harming the Mediterranean animal life. The animal he chose as a test case was the sea urchin, which lives on plants and is easy to observe in the laboratory. He set up a simple experiment.

CHARLES-FRANCOIS BOUDOURESQUE: Here is an urchin that has been fed on native Mediterranean algae. The mouth normally faces downwards. And we turn it over; we put it with its mouth facing upwards. We know that a sea urchin that is in good health takes about one minute to turn back over again to return to its natural position.

NARRATOR: Almost immediately the urchin began to put out little suckers, wave its spines and struggle to turn itself over. In less than a minute it had completed the maneuver.

CHARLES-FRANCOIS BOUDOURESQUE: There. What an athlete—it's a very good athlete.

NARRATOR: In another jar, Boudouresque had urchins fed exclusively on the new algae.

CHARLES-FRANCOIS BOUDOURESQUE: These urchins have been fed for a long time on Caulerpa taxifolia. We do the same experiment with them. We turn them over and measure the time they take to right themselves.

NARRATOR: The time they took to turn over crept up from two minutes, to five, to 20. Boudouresque suspected the urchins were finding the taxifolia inedible and were starving to death. After a month on an exclusive diet of taxifolia the turning-over time had reached 30 minutes. It soon became clear that some even preferred to die rather than eat the distasteful seaweed. The findings were very disturbing. If this new seaweed took over the Mediterranean, would other sea animals react in the same way? Would the whole food chain be disrupted?

What, the French researchers wondered, was the plant's secret weapon that stopped the urchins from eating it? Meinesz sent samples to a number of European labs specializing in plant toxins.

At the Max Planck Institute in Germany they began analyzing the chemical composition of the Caulerpa samples. The findings were unexpected. Many plants employ a chemical defense mechanism to ward off predators, but most use a variety of different toxins in relatively small quantities. The mysterious new algae turned out to be quite different.

GEORG POHNERT (Max Planck Institute): It is very special, because Caulerpa taxifolia is nearly entirely relying on one component that it is basing its whole chemical defense on. Usually plants use a multitude of different components that have all different target animals. Caulerpa taxifolia uses another strategy. It uses only one component, but this component is produced in a very high amount.

NARRATOR: It was the concentration of the toxin in the plant that was so unusual. The toxin is called "caulerpenine," and the concentration was higher than in any other algae Pohnert had ever analyzed.

GEORG POHNERT: The amount of toxin in the Mediterranean species is really surprisingly high for me as a chemist. It's a very powerful and very special defense mechanism. That might be why Caulerpa spreads in the Mediterranean very effectively.

NARRATOR: Pohnert discovered that although the toxin was not lethal to humans or animals, it made Caulerpa almost totally inedible. And if nothing would eat it, there was nothing to stop its advance. If it took over, the Mediterranean's animal life would be forced to flee or starve to death.

Alexandre Meinesz now believed he was dealing with not just any invasive plant, but an exceptionally harmful and vigorous organism. The algae continued to spread, growing at twice the speed of indigenous plants. And Meinesz was worried that the situation could rapidly get out of control unless something was done to stop it.

There was one hope. The colony of algae lay directly under the walls of one of Europe's most prestigious marine research and conservation organizations, the Monaco Oceanographic Museum. Meinesz felt sure the museum would help him. It would take money, resources and government involvement, but Meinesz was confident the museum would be able to persuade the French authorities to eradicate the algae before it spread further. He was in for a shock.

At the time, the museum was run by Professor Francois Doumenge, one of France's most influential marine biologists. For nearly a century, the Monaco museum has championed oceanographic conservation and preserved the riches of the sea in a series of palatial galleries.

Meinesz approached the museum with his concerns, but the museum's director had a very different view of the situation. He simply didn't believe the invasion of Caulerpa taxifolia was dangerous or unnatural.

FRANCOIS DOUMENGE (Former Director, Monaco Oceanographic Museum): The development of tropical species in the Mediterranean is an old story. Some species date back to the opening of the Swiss Canal and are well known, so there have been tropical species in the Mediterranean since the end of the 19th century.

NARRATOR: Doumenge argued that algaes like taxifolia are constantly moved around the world by sea currents and frequently lie dormant in the water for years, until a temperature change brings them to life.

FRANCOIS DOUMENGE: More and more, in my opinion, it is likely that there has always been a small and dispersed stock of dormant tropical species in the Mediterranean, and as the Mediterranean warms up and becomes more tropical, they start growing again. It's well known that the Mediterranean has experienced changes in level and temperature over time.

NARRATOR: Doumenge suggested Meinesz was worrying about nothing. The growth of the taxifolia was not a danger, merely a sign of the evolving character of the Mediterranean Sea.

FRANCOIS DOUMENGE: Eight to ten thousand years ago, the sea was 120 meters lower than it is now and three to five degrees cooler. So the Mediterranean should be seen as a basin which changes very rapidly on the geological time scale. Its current state is simply an intermediate state, a transitory phase. It's in this context that we should be looking at the Caulerpa.

NARRATOR: Doumenge passed on his thoughts to the French Ministry of the Environment, which breathed a sigh of relief. If the algae was not dangerous but part of a pattern of global change, there was not much the French government could be expected to do against such a natural occurrence. But not everyone was convinced.

Alexandre Meinesz was still alarmed by what he'd found and the impact it was having on the seabed. He'd spent years studying Caulerpa in the wild, and he was sure the invasion was not natural.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I was sure I wasn't making a mistake. I had seen something very strange. I immediately draft a report that I sent to the top authority, but I did not even receive an acknowledgement. I thought, "Even if they don't believe me, they could have sent an outside expert to come and have a look, even just to come and check I wasn't talking nonsense." But no, absolutely nothing.

NARRATOR: Over the next 18 months the algae spread, as Meinesz had feared it might. In 1990, there were sightings at Cap Martin, about two and a half miles east of Monaco, and at Toulon, almost 125 miles in the opposite direction. By late 1991, there were some dozen patches of the algae dotted along the French Riviera.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: It confirmed all my fears. The algae was beginning to spread. I could no longer keep quiet. I absolutely had to tell the media to try to make the people aware of it. It was an alien. Nobody before had ever described anything which grew so large, vigorously and densely.

NARRATOR: Local newspapers picked up the story. There were alarming and lurid headlines: "The Green Menace," "Ecological Crime," "Mutant Algae." The plant now acquired a new name: "the killer algae."

By the early 1990s, with the press finally involved, the French Ministry of the Environment stepped in. It sent a research ship to the affected area of the Mediterranean to see what was going on. At long last, there was official recognition that something might be wrong. The man in charge of the government's research effort was marine biologist Thomas Belsher.

Belsher sent down divers to chart the taxifolia beds.

THOMAS BELSHER (Research Institute for Marine Development): The progress of Caulerpa taxifolia can be followed by an underwater video camera, which is a few meters above the seabed. And each time we see some Caulerpa, we mark it. This allows us to make accurate maps of the observations.

NARRATOR: Almost immediately, Belsher found that Meinesz, if anything, had underestimated the size of the infestation and the rate it was growing.

THOMAS BELSHER: Our estimate suggested the spread of the Caulerpa was greater than Alexandre Meinesz had observed at the same spot a few months earlier. It was obvious that this population of Caulerpa taxifolia was still there, and it was growing very rapidly.

NARRATOR: It was, as Meinesz had already observed, bigger, faster growing, and denser than any algae ever seen before. Belsher's maps revealed that the Mediterranean seabed was being transformed more quickly than at any time in recent history.

THOMAS BELSHER: We had never seen an algae introduced into a marine ecosystem that had grown so quickly. At the end of one or two years, instead of having a very colorful seabed we had nothing in some places except a green lawn, like a golf course.

NARRATOR: Entire marine ecosystems were being affected by the Caulerpa infestations. Researchers found that fish populations around the invasive taxifolia beds were falling measurably. In some places, half the fish had disappeared. Fish, like urchins, appeared to find the taxifolia too toxic to eat.

The French authorities, still only half-convinced this was a problem they could solve, commissioned a series of small-scale experimental eradications. It soon became clear that destroying the plant was going to be much more difficult than anybody had expected. Divers were sent down to dig up patches of algae by hand, but it was like trying to trim a football field with a pair of scissors.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: This algae is very difficult to eradicate. You can see that the roots are as fine as hair and have fruits that may give rise to new plants, so to eliminate it by hand you have to remove much more than what you see. You have to remove everything underneath as well, the mud, the sand, because there might be little bits not visible to the eye.

NARRATOR: They tried freezing it to death with blocks of dried ice, but their efforts were no match for the scale of the problem. They even tried sucking it up with an underwater vacuum cleaner. The trials quickly showed that it would take an army of divers many years to make an impact on the algae.

By 1994, new sightings showed that the taxifolia had spread even further. Yet there was something very puzzling about the way it was spreading. It was not just expanding into the neighboring seabed; it was leaping from one section of coast to another, establishing new colonies hundreds of miles apart.

Meinesz knew that if the authorities were to slow its spread, they needed to understand what lay behind this apparently erratic pattern of growth. But there were those who still believed there was nothing to worry about. The director of the Monaco museum, Francois Doumenge, continued to suggest Meinesz was overreacting.

FRANCOIS DOUMENGE: In my opinion, if we'd taken time to consider the problem, if we'd tackled it with greater scientific calmness and not instantly concluded that it was a catastrophe, we'd have realized there was not much to worry about.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: My feeling was that I had to continue my investigations. I had to continue to convince people of the problem. It was a question of time. Something could perhaps still be done. I had to study its biology more closely, study its dynamics more closely, in order to see whether there was still time to do something.

NARRATOR: Meinesz went back to the lab. He suspected the key to understanding the plant's erratic spread was knowing how it reproduced.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: What we wanted to know is how this species reproduces. You have to take a little bit of juice that is in this caliper, put it on the slide, and look at it under a microscope.

NARRATOR: The sticky juice inside the taxifolia contains microscopic particles called gametes or reproductive cells. These are normally male and female and act like sperm and egg.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: Theoretically, you should find two types of gametes, reproductive organs, inside the juice. The gametes are very small. They measure five microns. The male gamete is the same size as the female gamete, but there is a small difference, the female gamete has a red dot, a stigma.

NARRATOR: Meinesz studied slides of the taxifolia looking for the red dot that identifies the female gamete. He couldn't find a single female gamete.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: We looked in vain for female gametes on the specimens from the Mediterranean. There were no female gametes, no sexual reproduction.

NARRATOR: There could be only one explanation. The taxifolia in the Mediterranean was spreading, not through sexual reproduction, but by a process known as vegetative reproduction. It's a form of cloning. It was an important breakthrough that finally made sense of the strange spread of the taxifolia.

It meant that any tiny fragment of the algae separated from the main plant contained all the genetic material necessary to grow an exact replica of the parent plant. It's as if a piece of human hair or a flake of skin dropped on the ground could grow into a complete human being. Meinesz now realized that it would only take a tiny fragment of the taxifolia, picked up by the anchor of one of the thousands of boats that crisscross the sea, to start a new colony of plants hundreds of miles away.

By 1997, a new map of the colonies of the algae seemed to confirm this hypothesis. It had jumped further along the coasts of France and Italy; it had even leapt across to the coast of Croatia. Eight years had passed since Meinesz first raised the alarm. Now, nowhere in the Mediterranean seemed safe.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: It was really sad to see, because it's a question of time. Time matters in these affairs. When a species begins to invade you have to act now.

NARRATOR: But no one acted, and Meinesz could only watch in horror as the weed continued to spread. Around this time, a dramatic discovery in Switzerland would soon throw new light on the algae's origins and confirm Meinesz's fears that there was something very unnatural about this plant.

It happened here at the University of Geneva. Olivier Jousson is a specialist in DNA sampling. He realized the only way to prove whether the gigantic taxifolia in the Mediterranean was a natural invasion was to trace its origins. If he could match its DNA to the DNA of any tropical taxifolia, then the theory that it had naturally drifted in from the tropics was probably right.

OLIVIER JOUSSON (University of Geneva): I realized that the main problem with Caulerpa was that nobody knew where it had come from.

NARRATOR: He set about processing dozens of samples of taxifolia from all over the world, including the Red Sea and areas of the Pacific. Nothing matched. Each time, the DNA fingerprint was different from the Mediterranean strain. It was a mystery. Eventually there was only one strain left to try. It was a perfect match. But this was not a wild plant; it had been bred by humans. It was a sample of Caulerpa taxifolia taken from an aquarium tank.

For years a very peculiar strain of Caulerpa taxifolia has been used to decorate tropical fish tanks. It appeared that it was this human-bred, artificial strain, which had escaped into the Mediterranean.

OLIVIER JOUSSON: The fact that these two are identical, in our opinion, means that they are the same plant. The strain that exists in the Mediterranean and the strain that exists in aquaria are the same.

NARRATOR: Jousson's discovery proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the taxifolia in the Mediterranean had not drifted in from the tropics. Monaco's argument that the appearance of taxifolia was part of a natural cycle of change in the sea did not hold up. It wasn't long before people also realized that if the findings were right, the most obvious source of the alien invasion was the Monaco Oceanographic Museum itself.

The museum was known to have had taxifolia in its tropical tanks and was also directly above the site of the first known infestation. Yet to suggest that the museum was even unwittingly responsible carried huge political and scientific implications. It meant the institute had somehow unknowingly allowed material from its aquarium tanks to get into the sea. Even worse, the most likely time for all this to have happened was in the early 1980s when the museum had been run by a man with an international reputation for marine research, Jacques Cousteau.

For years he'd been the father of French marine biology, a hero of marine conservation. The irony was that to accuse the Monaco Museum of even accidentally releasing a rogue seaweed into the sea, was to hold some of the most famous names in marine conservation responsible for what many now regarded as an ecological disaster. The museum flatly denied any link between the taxifolia in its tanks and the taxifolia below its walls and questioned the validity of the DNA findings.

FRANCOIS DOUMENGE: I think that the tests that were performed didn't use either the safest or best-known methods. What we need for an accurate answer is much more detailed, much finer genetic studies, using a much bigger range of samples than was practical before.

NARRATOR: But Doumenge was in the minority. Even Jacques Cousteau, when he later found out about the issue, told the French Minister of Environment that there might be cause for concern.

But with so much taxifolia in the sea, assigning blame seemed a waste of time. Scientists now realized that wherever the aquarium breed had come from, they were dealing with an extremely invasive plant. It was also remarkably adaptable. Unlike tropical taxifolia, it had a new and distinctive DNA fingerprint and could survive in winter water temperatures around 55, or 13 degrees Celsius.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I ask myself a question: "How can this algae which only lives in the tropics where it's always 20 degrees, withstand winters when it's 13 degrees? How could it stay alive?"

NARRATOR: The search for an answer lay in tracing the aquarium plant to its original source. The trail led from Monaco to an aquarium in Stuttgart, Germany. Here, during the 1970s, the staff made a curious discovery. At the time, people everywhere had been trying to find a plant that could be used to decorate tropical fish tanks. The world's leading aquariums imported wild specimens from the four corners of the globe, but nothing seemed to survive in the artificial environment of a tank.

But then, in the Stuttgart aquarium, something unexpected happened. A newly imported strain of wild Caulerpa taxifolia from the Pacific suddenly blossomed and thrived. It became the aquarium's wonder plant. At the time no one asked how, or why, it had flourished so rapidly. Now they did.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: The question of the nature of this algae gave me a lot of food for thought, and there are only two hypotheses. First hypothesis: someone selects a bunch of Caulerpa in the wild, which is slightly abnormal, more resistant to the cold, and it is this one that is grown in an aquarium and finds its way into the Mediterranean.

NARRATOR: In other words, a collector in the 1970s, had, by accident, selected an unusually big and robust sample of the plant in the wild, and it was this exceptional plant which had been grown in the Stuttgart aquarium. But there was also a second possibility.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: The second hypothesis: something happens in the aquarium to modify the plants. For some reason there is a change in its genetic structure, a mutation, a change in the chromosomes. It could be one of several things.

NARRATOR: Aquarium tanks use chemicals and lights to artificially recreate the natural balance of the sea. Could this manmade brew have caused the original wild strain to change or mutate into a more invasive plant than its wild cousin?

To this day no one has solved the mystery. And the discovery was rapidly overtaken by a new concern. Throughout the '80s and '90s, the German-bred algae was sent to aquariums around the world. It had become the most popular aquatic plant on earth. It was everywhere. If it could escape from one tank and survive, it could escape from others. And if it could flourish in the Mediterranean, it could flourish in dozens of other seas. The super algae that Alexandre Meinesz had warned France about 12 years before was now, potentially, a global problem.

California, with a huge trade in exotic plants, was always a likely victim. Aware of the growing Mediterranean problem, the United States listed Caulerpa taxifolia as a noxious weed and banned its importation. But aquariums and millions of tropical fish hobbyists could still buy existing supplies. It was only a matter of time before it escaped into the wild. And in June of 2000, that's just what happened. Caulerpa taxifolia was found in a coastal lagoon in southern California.

ROBERT HOFFMAN: It could have been simply a case of where the individual was cleaning his aquarium in his front yard, in the street. And he had the algae in the aquarium, and pieces of it floated down the gutter, got into the storm drain and then were just discharged into the lagoon, because there is a storm drain outlet right here, very close to where the infestation is.

NARRATOR: To avoid the disaster overtaking the Mediterranean, the officials in California knew they had to act fast. Within days, they'd settled on a radical campaign of eradication. The chosen weapon was chlorine, which kills everything in its path.

The chlorine is pumped down through a pipe from tanks on the surface into a tarpaulin, which has been spread over the algae and held down at the sides with pegs and sandbags. Everything under the tarp is killed: plants, fish, crustaceans. It's a price California is willing to pay.

GREIG PETERS: No matter what level, how harsh the chemical response is, if we're effective, it's hard to believe that that could be as bad as not being effective and having our whole coastline smothered by this algae.

NARRATOR: The chlorine, with an approximate strength of household bleach, acts almost immediately. Within hours, the taxifolia is dead. It's an extreme solution and expensive—more than a million dollars a year—but it seems to be working. In early 2003, no new growth of taxifolia was found. It's encouraging, but the lagoon will still have to be monitored for many years.

But the infestation in the Mediterranean has grown too large for this solution. After 15 years, the algae has won. Poison is simply impractical, and the scale of the destruction of wildlife would be completely unacceptable.

In France, some small underwater reserve areas have been identified that will be patrolled each year. If Caulerpa is discovered in these rich marine parks, it will be pulled out by hand.

But Alexandre Meinesz believes there is only one way to defeat this weed. It's more controversial than poison, it's more drastic than most people will accept. It's a tiny tropical slug that kills taxifolia as it eats it. At the University of Nice, Meinesz stumbled on it by accident.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: I heard from an American professor in Florida, who told me there was a slug that fed exclusively on Caulerpa. To begin with, I didn't take him very seriously. I couldn't believe that these little slugs could make much difference to the enormous amount of Caulerpa we've got here. Then, by accident, we imported some of them in a bunch of Caulerpa from the Caribbean. So we began studying them and looking at their potential as a biological weapon against Caulerpa taxifolia, and we have a few hopes.

NARRATOR: The slug is unique in producing an enzyme that enables it to eat the plant and neutralize its toxin.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: What is extraordinary is the way these slugs eat the Caulerpa. They don't chew it as we eat salad. They make a small hole and suck out the juice.

NARRATOR: It's like a vampire, sucking out the juice and leaving a dying husk. Meinesz would like to release thousands of these tropical slugs into the sea to attack the taxifolia beds. While they could never eradicate the existing Caulerpa, he believes they could slow down the spread. But it's not nearly as straightforward as it sounds. There are two problems. The French authorities are understandably wary of introducing yet another alien species into the Mediterranean and have so far refused to fund the research. Yet Meinesz is sure the slug has evolved such a specialized and exclusive dependence on Caulerpa, it won't attack anything else.

ALEXANDRE MEINESZ: All the studies we've done tell us that there would be no danger if these little slugs were released into the Mediterranean.

NARRATOR: The other problem is that this little slug from Florida can't survive in the deeper, colder, Mediterranean waters. Meinesz is now calling on the world's scientists to find a related slug that can tolerate the lower temperatures and munch the taxifolia problem away. In the meantime, no temperate ocean is safe, as Australian Broadcast News reports a new infestation.

REPORTER:	South Australia's $500,000,000 fishing and aquaculture industry is under threat, and the government has declared war.

NARRATOR: It was actually Australia's second Caulerpa attack. But this one was much bigger than California's and harder to handle. The government quickly started testing methods to control it. Huge quantities of salt would kill the weed, but the infestation was so large, they worried there wasn't enough salt in all of Australia to work.

They also considered something more drastic: pumping copper sulfate into the water. It would kill every living thing and close the lagoon for two years. While copper sulfate may well prevent the weed from moving into the open ocean and threatening the fishing industry, for many Australians, it's just too controversial. So no decision has been made. For now, they're trying to stem the spread by pulling the taxifolia out by hand.

Fifteen years after it was first discovered, Caulerpa taxifolia now grows in nine countries on four continents. The problem is entirely manmade. Today, millions of tropical fish hobbyists still decorate their aquariums with this brightly colored but dangerous plant. Improper disposal of even a tiny fragment of Caulerpa taxifolia can start the next infestation as this green monster continues to spread throughout the world's oceans.

It's not just this invasive plant that we need to worry about, other alien species are attacking habitats in waters and on land around the world.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON (Astrophysicist, American Museum of Natural History): On this episode of NOVA scienceNOW, physicists are revving up for a landmark event.

PETER FISHER (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): It's a big step, this is a big time.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: They're about to turn on the world's largest machine...

MEENAKSHI NARAIN (Brown University): We may find things which nobody has ever thought of.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: ...in their quest to find out exactly what the universe is made of.

PETER FISHER: It's just a voyage of discovery.

TEJINDER VIRDEE (CMS Deputy Spokesperson, CERN): Mind-boggling.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Mind-boggling and mysterious as the synchronized movements of flocks of birds, schools of fish, and even crowds of humans.

JOHN HOLLAND: Behavior of the whole is more than the sum of the parts; and that's the flag for emergence.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Could the science of emergence unlock the secrets of intelligence? Even the origins of life itself?

ROBERT HAZEN (Carnegie Institution of Washington): This whole concept gives us a whole new way of thinking about the universe.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Also, why are these fruit flies being rolled, bumped, tormented, on a machine called the Deprivator? It's all in the name of sleep research.

MATTHEW WILSON (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Sleep is an enigma. What is its purpose? That's something that we do not understand.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But new studies indicate that one purpose of sleep may be to help us learn, that while we snooze, our brains replay memories, maybe even editing and enhancing them.

ROBERT STICKGOLD (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center): The brain is being modified while we sleep, so that when we wake up in the morning, in some way, we have a different brain.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: All that and more on this episode of NOVA scienceNOW.

SLEEP

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Hello. I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, your host for NOVA scienceNOW.

We all know that dreams can be, dreams can be a little weird, sometimes filled with bizarre events that would never happen in real life. Nobody really knows why we dream. In fact, nobody really knows why we sleep.

Here are some folks who are trying to figure it out.

Amita Sehgal likes her flies, fruit flies, to be precise.

AMITA SEHGAL (University of Pennsylvania and Howard Hughes Medical Institute): I do have a genuine affection for them.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But sometimes, she has a strange way of showing that affection—especially, when she puts them into this thing.

AMITA SEHGAL: We use this piece of equipment we call "The Deprivator."

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: The Deprivator? It's like riding a roller coaster during an earthquake.

What's interesting to Sehgal is what the flies do after spending a whole night in here. The flies on the left were undisturbed last night, and they look fine. But the flies on the right, they were jostled all night long in the Deprivator. Now, some of them look dead, but they're not. According to Sehgal, they're catching up on lost sleep.

AMITA SEHGAL: If we keep flies awake at night, they need to make up for the sleep they have lost, and so will sleep in the morning, at a time when they're normally active.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But why would flies need to sleep? Could it be for the same reason we need to sleep? Maybe. But if you ask an expert what exactly that reason is...

MATTHEW P. WALKER (Harvard Medical School): We actually know very little about what sleep is doing for the brain.

AMITA SEHGAL: We spend a third of our lives sleeping. If you don't sleep, you die.

MATT WILSON: Sleep is an enigma. What is its purpose? That's something that we do not understand.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Looks like a waste of time. But then why would so many creatures do it?

MATT WILSON: Sleep is something that, the more we look at it, the more we see that it is fundamental. It's fundamental to essentially all organisms.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Including, it seems, organisms like fruit flies. When they're not being knocked around all night, Amita Sehgal's flies follow a pretty familiar schedule.

AMITA SEHGAL: They're active during the day and they sleep at night, for the most part, although there is an afternoon siesta as well, especially in males.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Trying to pinpoint the reason for a fly to snooze up to 12 hours a night, Sehgal's lab studies the fruit fly's brain.

AMITA SEHGAL: What we were doing was trying to figure out which part of the fly brain was important for sleep.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Sehgal's experiments pointed to the mushroom body, a part of the brain found in creatures like insects and spiders, but not in humans. Biologists have known about the mushroom body for years, but they associated it, not with sleep, but with something else entirely, an insect's memory.

AMITA SEHGAL: There is, then, this structure in the fly brain, which we already knew was required for memory, and we now find that it controls sleep.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: The finding's intriguing because, for a long time now, sleep researchers have been debating a possible connection between sleep and memory.

Bob Stickgold has been looking into this possibility, sometimes in unconventional ways. For him, video games are research tools that can help reveal how our brains learn.

ROBERT STICKGOLD: Do you remember when you first started playing Tetris®...

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Oh, yeah.

ROBERT STICKGOLD: ...that you went to bed at night, and you lay in bed, and you closed your eyes, and you saw little Tetris pieces floating around in front of your eyes?

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: How did you know that? How did you know that...

ROBERT STICKGOLD: Because...

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: ...I dreamed Tetris shapes?

ROBERT STICKGOLD: ...because everybody does.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: After taking a few rides on a ski machine, Stickgold's research subjects fall asleep, and then he promptly wakes them up.

ROBERT STICKGOLD: If we wake you up just two or three minutes after you fall asleep and ask you, "Neil, what's going through your mind?" You'll say, "Seeing those suckers somersaulting down when I crash."

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And why would I dream of this embarrassing moment?

Stickgold is convinced that while you sleep, your brain is reviewing what you've learned and strengthening your memories.

ROBERT STICKGOLD: The brain is being modified while we sleep, so that when we wake up in the morning, in some way, we have a different brain. And it's a brain that functions better.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: At least it seems to function better on some kinds of memory tasks. Recent studies show that after a single night's sleep, sometimes even after a nap, we can do a better job recognizing visual patterns and even solving some math puzzles.

MATTHEW WALKER: What we're going to have you do is try and type out a short, five-digit sequence.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: I saw it first hand when I took a simple typing test, typing a string of five numbers over and over again as fast as I could.

After a night's sleep, I could suddenly type the numbers faster and more accurately. And research backs this up. Most people improved their typing by about 20 percent after sleep.

MATTHEW WALKER: Practice doesn't make perfect. It seems to be practice with a night of sleep that makes perfect. Sleep is enhancing that memory so that when you come back the next day you're even better than where you were the day before.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But exactly how could sleep enhance your memory? We don't know. But possible clues have been showing up, not just in the brains of flies, but in the dreams of rats.

MIT researcher Matt Wilson says he can read rats' minds, including their dreams, with tiny electric probes.

MATT WILSON: What it means is that we're able to, at any time, plug in our electronics, and...

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Figure out what they're thinking.

MATT WILSON: ...read their, read their mind.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Wilson's mind-readers are actually thin wires, about a tenth of the width of a human hair, that pick up the electrical signals among dozens of brain cells.

The wires—painlessly implanted in the rat's brain, and held there by a kind of hat—carry the signals right into Wilson's computers.

That information comes up back through these connectors into your computer, and you're sitting there watching a map of the thoughts of this rat?

MATT WILSON: Exactly. That's exactly right.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: It's remarkable.

Wilson is most interested in mapping the rat's thoughts in a part of its brain called the hippocampus. Like the fruit fly's mushroom body, the hippocampus of a rat or a human plays an important role in memory, including our sense of space and location.

Wilson uses a specially designed rat maze. If the rat follows the right route, he's rewarded with some chocolate syrup. And as he moves through each different spot in the maze in search of his goal, a unique pattern of cells fires in his brain.

MATT WILSON: So we can tell where the animal is, simply based upon which cells in the hippocampus are active. That pattern will be unique for a given location in a given environment.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: What's amazing is that the same patterns turn up again, even after the rat drifts off to sleep.

That's right, Wilson eavesdrops on his rats' dreams. And they aren't about cheese, they're about running the maze.

MATT WILSON: So when the animals would go to sleep, we would see these patterns of brain activity that were expressed while the animals were running on the maze, being replayed, in the same sequence, the same order in which they had been experienced.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But the replay wasn't exactly the same as when the rat ran the maze. Sometimes it was like an extreme fast-forward; quick flashes of the experience.

MATT WILSON: Now, at the time, you never know what is going to be important and what is not important. So you may re-evaluate or edit those memories to identify the things that were important.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And this fragmented replay wasn't just happening in the hippocampus. Wilson also detected it in the visual cortex, meaning the rats were likely seeing the maze in their sleep.

What's more, the visual cortex is part of the larger neocortex, which, in humans, is responsible for, among other things, long-term memory.

MATTHEW WALKER: The hippocampus is replaying the events of the day. The hippocampus is almost, sort of, reactivating the memories at night and playing them out to the neocortex. It's almost as though the hippocampus is having a therapy session with the, with the neocortex. And it's almost saying, "Okay, here's what we learned during the day."

MATT WILSON: What are rats and what are people doing during sleep? They are processing memory. They are replaying memory. Now, we could ask, "Is this about learning?" And I believe that's exactly what it is about, that animals are, and humans are trying to learn from past experience.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So, the idea here is that the sleeping brain might be reviewing and strengthening new memories it wants to hold on to for the long-term. And it might identify certain goals we want to work towards. Some believe the sleeping brain could lead us to real insights.

ROBERT STICKGOLD: We all know about "sleeping on a problem." And sleeping on a problem is when you have a lot of new information and don't know what to do with it, and you can't decide how to interpret it. And so you say, "Let me sleep on it." And, with remarkable success rates, you can wake up the next morning and have an answer to a problem that you couldn't find the answer to the night before. And that's all about processing information, processing memories in the brain.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: So could it be that sleeping on it isn't just an old saying but a biological process that consolidates and organizes important information?

MATT WILSON: These are pretty big concepts. And they certainly are controversial. The function of sleep, as it relates to learning and memory, that's something that, at this point, remains speculation. We're making a leap.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Not everybody is leaping into bed with this idea. And researchers have a long way to go before they know what sleep is really doing for our brains. But if the speculation turns out to be true, then you'd have to wonder, "What is our 24/7 culture doing to our ability to think straight?"

MATTHEW WALKER: Sleep is not just something that we can choose to sort of dabble in every now and again. It's not a luxury; it's a biological necessity.

MATT WILSON: My sense is that disruption of sleep is much deeper than simply, you know, robbing us of rest. My guess would be that we lose the opportunity to gain understanding, a deep understanding of our past experience, that what we sacrifice, in a sense, is wisdom.
CERN

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: In the movies, crazy scientists who build time machines are always obsessing about power, like it takes so many jiggawatts of electricity to get the thing to work.

Well, a bunch of real scientists have been working for years on one giant experiment, trying to create exotic particles that haven't existed in the universe for 14 billion years, back to the Big Bang itself.

Physicist and correspondent David Wark reports that, in a way, it's a giant time machine. Just like in the movies, it's all about energy.

DAVE WARK: (Correspondent): You'd never guess that, hidden beneath these French mountains, an army of workers is underground, constructing the biggest and most complex machine on Earth.

It's a project that's got physicists around the world brimming with anticipation.

PETER FISHER: It's a big step, this is a big time.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: We may find things which nobody has ever thought of, or told us before.

STEVE AHLEN (Boston University): It's a real adventure because we don't know if it's going to work.

DAVE WARK: The goal of this giant construction project is nothing less than to find the basic building blocks of the universe.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: The basic quest of particle physics is, "What is the world made of? Do we know everything? Do we know all the constituents of matter? Do we have them all?"

DAVE WARK: Scientists have already found a whole carnival of subatomic particles that make up the universe.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: List some names.

STEVE AHLEN: Matter as we know it today...

PETER FISHER: There are protons, neutrons. That's what we're made of.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: The top quark...

STEVE AHLEN: ...bottom quark

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: The up...

STEVE AHLEN: ...and the down quarks.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: ...the charm quark, the strange quark...

STEVE AHLEN: There was a time when we just named everything something silly.

PETER FISHER: There are pions, kaons...

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: ...W-bosons, Z-bosons.

PETER FISHER: ...five different upsilon particles...lambdas...

STEVE AHLEN: ...gluons for the strong force...

PETER FISHER: ...omegas, sigmas.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: ...muons.

STEVE AHLEN: Who ordered that?

PETER FISHER: And my favorite particle is the tau.

DAVE WARK: This panoply of particles is called The Standard Model, and it's our best picture of what the universe is made of.

But as dazzling as it is, we know that the carnival is incomplete. There have to be other hidden particles out there, and we need a new experiment to find them.

Normally physicists don't get to ride in helicopters, but today we want to see the world's largest experiment, and up here's really the only place you can get a sense of the scale.

Below me is the construction site at CERN, a particle physics lab. The new experiment is so big it stretches from the mountains in France, across the border, to the Geneva Airport in Switzerland. That's because the main part consists of a circular tunnel, 16 miles around. The tunnel is home to the world's biggest, most powerful particle accelerator ever, called the Large Hadron Collider or LHC. Because it's so big, LHC will let us probe deeper into the stuff of the universe than we've ever gone before.

This tunnel is being filled with giant electro-magnets, and, in fact, you can see some of them on the ground right there.

This is my stop.

Each tubular magnet costs close to a million dollars, and the LHC will need more than 1,600 of them.

So what is this?

MARTA BAJKO (Accelerator Technology Group, CERN): This is the magnet; this is the magnet which is inside this big blue tube.

DAVE WARK: The magnets are designed to keep those tiny parts of an atom called protons flowing in a narrow beam through the tunnel. When they are all connected together into a ring, the magnets will create a 16-mile racetrack for protons.

In the ring, the powerful magnetic fields force the protons to go round in a circle, and each time they go round they get a little kick from an electric field, so they go faster and faster until, eventually, they are traveling almost at the speed of light.

MARTA BAJKO: In fact, the particles, they are traveling in these two tubes. In one of the tubes the particles are traveling in one direction, in the other tube in the opposite direction.

DAVE WARK: So there's actually two beams of particles, going in opposite directions?

MARTA BAJKO: Exactly. Yes.

DAVE WARK: One beam going one way and one beam going the other way. And there are two beams because you are going to collide them?

MARTA BAJKO: Exactly.

DAVE WARK: This is a technique that's familiar to physicists. A proton traveling close to the speed of light, although absolutely tiny, will carry a lot of energy. Two of them traveling in opposite directions will carry twice the energy. Make them collide and most of that energy can be released in a tiny, but powerful explosion.

With enough energy, the explosion should create fundamental particles that we've never seen before. If that happens, it'll be in a tiny region smack in the center of a vast underground cavern.

This is one of the four places around the ring where the two beams will actually collide. One beam will come from a tiny beam pipe, from the middle of that hole over there, and fly over my head. The second beam comes through that hole over there, and high up over my head, in the middle of the cavity, the two protons will collide.

Now, we're colliding two tiny little protons. Why do we need this vast cavern to find out what happens? Well, in order to detect if any new particles have been created in a collision, researchers have to fill this cavern with some of the most complex scientific instruments ever created.

The one here is called CMS.

This is one end of the vast CMS detector; the whole detector consists of a series of these plates, each one of which is instrumented with thousands of detectors you can see up here. As we move down we see a large number of these which will all be slid together to make the final detector. No space at all is wasted. This big hole looks like a hole in the detector, but in fact the hole in those detectors is filled by these detectors.

Different detectors pick up different kinds of particles, and sandwiched together they'll create a single enormous cylinder which completely surrounds the point where the protons collide. That's important because, as the particles fly away from the collision through the detector, they will leave tracks which form a kind of fingerprint.

It's by analyzing these fingerprints that scientists should be able to tell if a new particle was briefly created at the moment of collision.

PETER FISHER: That's why the experiments are hugely complicated. They have to identify all the things that come out of two protons that hit.

STEVE AHLEN: The LHC experiments are by far the most difficult that have ever been done in high energy physics, and maybe any experiment.

DAVE WARK: In fact, the experiments are so complicated it takes physicists from dozens of countries to pull them off.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 1: I'm from Switzerland.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 2: I'm from Belgium.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 3: ...sono Italiana, Toscana.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 4: ...France.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 5: ...Japan.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 6: ...Austin, Texas.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 7: ...Russian.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 8: ...UK.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 9: ...California.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 15: ...Argentina.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 16: I'm from Togo, West Africa.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 17: I'm from Brazil.

LHC TEAM MEMBER 18: And I'm from the Czech Republic.

JIM BENSINGER (Brandeis University): You meet people from all over the world. You talk with them; you get their point of view; you exchange ideas. They all tend to be physicists, so it's not that wide, but I find that's exciting. If the rest of the world worked the way we do, we'd have far fewer problems.

DAVE WARK: One problem they do have is analyzing the vast mountain of data that the LHC is going to produce, because, when it's running, it'll create about a billion proton collisions a second. And it'll be running 24/7.

TEJINDER VIRDEE: We get 40 million megabytes of data created every second.

DAVE WARK: Forty million megabytes, 40,000 gigabytes, or that would be 1,000 large discs for your home computer every second.

TEJINDER VIRDEE: Yes, it's mind boggling. The amount of data that we are generating in one year is 10 times bigger than all the World-Wide-Web-stored data.

DAVE WARK: In fact, the World Wide Web was invented here at CERN to analyze the results of earlier experiments.

But the LHC has so much more data, it will need the power of the Web's successor, something called "the GRID." Using millions of computers around the world, the GRID will turn high-speed computing power into just another commodity, like music or telephone service, that, someday soon, everyone will be able to buy online.

It's all part of a quest to understand the world in minute detail.

One mystery scientists would love to solve is why some of the particles now whizzing around the universe have mass.

STEVE AHLEN: The fact is, from a physicist's point of view, from a philosopher's point of view, from an observational point of view, mass is actually quite mysterious.

DAVE WARK: In our best theory of matter, the Standard Model, all the really fundamental particles are like photons—the particles of light—in that they have no intrinsic mass.

But we know that objects in the real world have mass, and scientists know that particles like protons and electrons also have mass. So where does that mass come from?

PETER FISHER: Why do particles have different masses? And why do they have mass at all? Mass is not something that emerges naturally from a theory.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: We basically do not understand why some particles got mass and others didn't. What happened? What gave mass?

DAVE WARK: The leading idea for explaining mass is something called the Higgs field, a field which we believe pervades all of space and which the fundamental particles interact with.

The Higgs field is like cosmic cotton candy; it sticks to everything. And, according to this idea, it's actually that stickiness that gives particles their mass.

If the Higgs field, along with a Higgs particle, really exists, then the Large Hadron Collider should find it. And that would be a triumph for the Standard Model.

But since the LHC will take the particle hunt to a whole new level, many physicists are hoping it will uncover types of matter we've never even dreamed of.

MEENAKSHI NARAIN: The best case, in my mind: we do not find the Higgs particle, and we find a whole new set of new particles.

STEVE AHLEN: I don't really care what we find. You know, I just want to go off there and look at something and see something no one's ever seen before. That's what motivates me.

PETER FISHER: It's just a voyage of discovery. It's looking out into the cosmos and trying to see where we fit in it.
EMERGENCE

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Many people think that the laws of nature and the universe tell us that everything breaks down. Things fall apart, energy wanes, living things grow old and die. Yes, we have some good laws which explain all that, but what about the emergence of life? What about the complexity of life? Where do they come from? Are these rare, miraculous developments? Or is this kind of complexity inevitable, following natural laws we just haven't quite figured out yet?

Correspondent Carla Wohl went looking for the answer.

CARLA WOHL (Correspondent): It is mysterious how a flock of birds or a school of fish move as one, with such grace and coordination, as if there's one brain behind them all or an invisible force at play. An explanation may be found in emergence, a science that tries to explain complex patterns and behavior that arise in the world around us.

Some believe emergence may reveal more than just how birds and fish do this, but how we think and how life itself began in the first place.

But while many of science's mysteries long have been explained—gravity, we predict with Newton's laws of gravity, and magnetism, through Maxwell's laws—but things like this remain largely unpredictable.

JOHN HOLLAND: Emergence, when you first see it, seems mysterious. But then, if I go back and read the papers at the time of Maxwell, electromagnetism seemed very mysterious, too.

CARLA WOHL: Let's start with what we do know about emergence. It's an order we might not expect to see. Usually where there is order, there is a leader—a conductor of an orchestra or a general with his army—orders come from the top, and they go down.

JOHN HOLLAND: Yeah, and they go down.

KEITH STILL (Crowd Dynamics Limited): Top-down order, where you have one brain controlling the functions of the entire group.

CARLA WOHL: A leader at the top and many who follow down below: it's just how we expect things to be.

So who's in charge here? Him? No.

Him? Unh uh.

JOHN HOLLAND: There's no conductor; there's no general.

ROBERT HAZEN: There's no leader. There's no director that's telling every fish where to go.

CARLA WOHL: Well, then what about these birds?

KEITH STILL: There's no one in charge of the birds either.

CARLA WOHL: So if the order isn't coming from the top down, where is it coming from?

JOHN HOLLAND: The organization comes from the bottom up. So, at the bottom, we have these things that are following their own sets of rules, often fairly simple. One is to go in the same direction as the other guys. Another is "Don't get too close, but don't get too far from my neighbors."

CARLA WOHL: And perhaps the most important rule: if someone's coming after you, get out of the way.

From these simple rules, very complex patterns can spontaneously emerge.

JOHN HOLLAND: What we see is a pattern emerging from the bottom up.

CARLA WOHL: And so it came to be called "emergent complexity" or simply, "emergence."

Of course, different creatures have different rules, but whether ants or wildebeests or this slime mold...

JOHN HOLLAND: The behavior emerges from the actions that are controlled by the rules, and behavior of the whole is more than the sum of the parts. And that's the flag for emergence.

CARLA WOHL: And you might not have noticed it, but it's not just seen in animals.

KEITH STILL: Similarly, with crowds; there are no leaders within certain types of crowds.

CARLA WOHL: Crowds of people? We do it just like the birds and fish?

KEITH STILL: Movement is happening at a very much subconscious level. You don't think about how to walk, you just do it.

CARLA WOHL: Keith Still studies the emergent complexity in crowds. He says these people crossing the street have no idea they're part of a larger pattern.

KEITH STILL: As if they're following each other in long conga lines, what happens is that the first individual that finds a gap is being followed by those people that find it easier to follow something that's moving in roughly the right direction than it is to carve their own path through the crowd.

CARLA WOHL: So emergence happens with all kinds of living things that move in groups.

KEITH STILL: It can be a crowd, it can be a flock of birds, a school of fish. These are all emergent phenomena, when you're getting a large-scale order out of a small-scale interaction.

CARLA WOHL: But emergent complexity can be found in non-living things as well.

JOHN HOLLAND: Anything I know that exhibits emergence, involves, a lot of, we might call them agents, a lot of individuals or parts. We could call them parts.

CARLA WOHL: John Holland's first experience with emergence came from some fairly unsophisticated electronic parts that came together to create something almost intelligent. And he saw it a half century ago with a game of checkers.

You used to look at this as child's play, right?

JOHN HOLLAND: Yes, I did.

CARLA WOHL: I believe it's your move, too, by the way.

JOHN HOLLAND: Oh, all right.

CARLA WOHL: What changed your mind?

JOHN HOLLAND: What changed my mind was my encounter at IBM—this was in the early '50s—I was busy at that time simulating neural networks.

CARLA WOHL: Meanwhile, a coworker, Arthur Samuel, was doing something else.

JOHN HOLLAND: He programmed the machine to play checkers. And I thought, "Well, what he's doing is interesting, but that isn't anywhere near as deep as simulating neurons."

CARLA WOHL: It's checkers, right?

JOHN HOLLAND: Yeah, it's checkers.

CARLA WOHL: As it turned out Samuel had achieved something far deeper than anyone at IBM expected.

JOHN HOLLAND: He programmed the rules, and the machine would move according to the rules.

CARLA WOHL: Not only was the computer following the basic rules of checkers, it had another set of rules as well, a strategy to favor moves that might lead to victory.

JOHN HOLLAND: Simply by its experience with him and other players, it favored better moves than he did. That machine learned well enough that it could actually beat Samuel himself. With this learning I have emergence.

CARLA WOHL: It was emergent because when the computer followed simple rules, something as unpredictable and complex as learning emerged, something—until then—only living things could do.

Fifty years later, computers really don't seem to have come all that far.

(Film clip from 2001: A Space Odyssey): Good evening, Dave. How you doing, Hal?

CARLA WOHL: 2001 has come and gone.

(Film clip from 2001: A Space Odyssey): I've wondered whether you might be having some second thoughts about the mission.

CARLA WOHL: Computers were supposed to be having conversations with us, thinking for themselves. So why can't they?

Holland says that's because there's another important factor in emergence to consider: complexity depends on how connected the parts are to each other.

JOHN HOLLAND: Compare the central nervous system, our brain, to a computer. There's a major difference. Each element in a computer, each transistor, contacts, at most, 10 other elements, but in the human brain each individual neuron contacts 10,000 other neurons.

CARLA WOHL: So the sheer number of neurons in our brain, as well as the number of connections between them, is what makes our brain so much more complex than a computer.

JOHN HOLLAND: I've got billions of neurons and each one touching 10,000 others, so we get the emergence and, maybe—some of us believe that—consciousness is one of the emergent phenomena here.

CARLA WOHL: Consciousness? Could something so complex spontaneously emerge from individual parts following simple rules? It may seem counter-intuitive. Many of us think that without a leader or a plan, things become more disordered with time.

ROBERT HAZEN: Our intuition about the world is that things deteriorate, we get old, we die.

CARLA WOHL: Buildings crumble, we expect decay.

ROBERT HAZEN: This is the increase that's inevitable in the universe of disorder.

CARLA WOHL: But if order can emerge from disorder, could we actually expect to see something as complex as life itself emerge?

ROBERT HAZEN: Many of us believe that life follows inevitably as another emergent complex phenomenon.

CARLA WOHL: Bob Hazen, an astrobiologist with the Carnegie Institution is trying to find out if life on Earth emerged from simple molecules arranging themselves into something living.

Hazen hypothesizes that the right molecules, under the right conditions will do this, form increasingly more complex structures, and those complex structures will form even more complex structures and so on, until finally you get life.

To start he needed a simple molecule. He chose pyruvic acid.

ROBERT HAZEN: Pyruvic acid is a good proxy for the kind of simple molecule that would have been abundant on the early Earth. It's colorless, it's basically odorless.

You load it into a gold tube—it's like threading a needle—you then seal this up.

CARLA WOHL: Hazen is trying to reproduce the energy of the heat and pressure deep within the Earth.

ROBERT HAZEN: Typical conditions that might occur in volcanic zones on the floor of the ocean.

Seal this up.

CARLA WOHL: He pressurizes and heats the capsules to 250 degrees centigrade.

ROBERT HAZEN: Just like a pressure cooker.

Emergent complexity takes place in any environment where you have lots of agents coming together, molecules coming together, and energy.

CARLA WOHL: And in a week's time he's re-created the heat and pressure. The one thing missing is water.

ROBERT HAZEN: That's the magic trick. Put it in water, and bingo! Those molecules self-organize into an enclosure—cell-like structures called vesicles, a structure which is essential for life.

CARLA WOHL: So here the agents are molecules. The rules are the rules of chemistry. What emerges is one step closer to something biological, an important first step towards life.

ROBERT HAZEN: And the origin of life must have been a sequence of emergent steps from simplicity to complexity. You go from the simplicity of volcanic gases like carbon dioxide and water to organic molecules.

CARLA WOHL: Still, a vesicle needs to capture energy and nutrients to grow, replicate and divide, before it can truly be a living thing.

And whether these steps are emergent is, for Bob Hazen, the great mystery to be solved.

ROBERT HAZEN: This whole concept of emergent complexity gives us a whole new way of thinking about the universe, going from the simplicity of the earliest universe to the complexity of the modern, living world.

JOHN HOLLAND: Even Hawking says complexity is the study of the 21st century. Maybe in 20 years it'll be the standard science, for all I know.

ROBERT HAZEN: Scientists would love to quantify emergent complexity. We'd love to be able to have a formula that told us what systems become complex, how complex they become.

JOHN HOLLAND: My guess is that we will find some laws that will let us describe some things in these complex adaptive systems, patterns that we can recognize and maybe even make predictions about. And that's the great advantage of Newton, of Maxwell. And maybe someday we'll get our own Maxwell.
PROFILE: JULIE SCHABLITSKY

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Most of us think of the Old West as the stuff of myth and legend and cowboy movies. But the West was made by very real people, and people always leave stuff behind. So if you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, like the archeologist in this episode's profile, you might just discover the real story behind the myth buried beneath the dirt and the sand.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY (University of Oregon): We're just about there. And this just might be a little deeper, or perhaps may go down even.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie Schablitsky is an historical archeologist with the University of Oregon.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: I feel like I'm a shot-putter.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: She's not afraid to get her hands dirty, as she digs for the truth, literally.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Oooh, looks like an alcohol bottle.

Each archeologist that goes off to a site is looking for a story.

It's a crown cap, though, so what's the middle mark? Is that C, G together? I can date that here.

A story that will tell them something different about the people who used to live there.

What does the base of the bottle say? An S?

Something that hasn't been known before.

"William Franz & Sons 1900-1929. Milwaukee, Wisconsin."

So the Holy Grail is not necessarily an object, it's a story.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie brings her passion for her science to what was once the site of a 19th century Chinatown, in John Day, Oregon. That's where she's trying to tell the story of the thousands of Chinese laborers who came West in the late 1800s.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: The Chinese were instrumental in building the railroads. They were instrumental in mining. They made shoes; they were cobblers; they cut hair; they were servants in people's homes; they were cooks. Like all immigrant communities you really build a country on their backs.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Yet there are almost no written records from or about the Chinese of that era.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: You don't see them documenting their life in journals. And very seldom do you find even letters that went back and forth between them and their families. So you have this gap of what it was like to be Chinese in 19th century America.

Ooh. Yup. It's a single-dose medicine bottle. It's Chinese, umhmm, Chinese, definitely Chinese.

And what archeology can do is it can fill in those gaps, and give the voiceless Chinese that voice.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie's love of archeology started very early. Her first digs took place on the gravel driveway of her Minnesota home where she grew up. By the time she was seven, this self-assured second-grader was telling her classmates she had found her life's calling.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Back then, I thought about archaeology as being a lot of the gold idols with the ruby eyes, and mummies, and things from a far away land. And I never realized that archeology could be in your own backyard.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An idea that grew along with her, through elementary school into high school. Even the poster on her bedroom door was of an atypical rock star.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Ramesses II is not the average teen idol, but I found him quite interesting.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Today her interests have gone beyond the idols and icons and even the physical artifacts themselves.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: We found a coin purse.

MARY OBERST: Oh my gosh. Sure enough.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: The bottle that you could pick up, the arrowhead you could hold in your hand, and think that, wow, someone made this—that's what really grabbed my interest. But what held it was that when I began to put these artifacts together and tell a story that was really important.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And that's exactly what Julie helped to do, on a headline-making excavation, involving one of the great and gruesome stories of the Old West: the story of the Donner party, the group of west-bound pioneers who, because of bad luck, an ill-chosen route, and early snows, were trapped in the California mountains for a bitter winter in 1846 to '47.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: So you had a little over 80 people, stranded in the Sierra Nevadas, in two different camps. In both camps, about half the people lived and about half the people died.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Just what the living did to survive horrified everyone who heard the story. Some survivors in the larger of the two Donner party camps admitted they had cannibalized the bodies of those who had already died.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: It seemed that everyone was assured that cannibalism was participated in by every single member of the Donner family party. I think a lot of people believe that they survived by eating each other.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie was the co-leader of a team that recently went back to the second camp, to get a fuller story of what really happed there, more than 150 years ago.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: We wanted to know if they cannibalized. We wanted to know, if they didn't cannibalize, how'd they survive? How desperate did they become? What did they eat?

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie's team discovered a buried hearth and a trove of burned and chop-marked bones. She took those bones, and did what she's become known for: Julie brought in experts from other scientific disciplines, in this case, forensic bone analysts.

Their findings? Those chopped, boiled bones were those of hunted deer and rabbit, of their horses, even dog, but no humans.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: These people ate their family dog. They did everything in their power to extract every last nutrient before they did the unthinkable.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Thanks to Julie and her team, about half of the Donner party members at the second campsite were exonerated, correcting the sensationalized stories of the entire Donner party quickly resorting to cannibalism.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: It looks like only several people did participate in cannibalism, and not until the very, very end of their entrapment. So I think that's a real big finding for us.

JON ERLANDSON (University of Oregon): I think she's something of an emerging star in historical archaeology.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Go!

NANCY NIEDERNHOFER (Oregon Parks and Recreation Department): One of the things that I love so much about Julie, and I especially enjoy working with her, is the enthusiasm.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: That's way cool.

NANCY NIEDERNHOFER: It's so infectious.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Oh, wait. Oh, my gosh. I think this is a soy s.... It looks like right on top of this board here is a spout from a soy sauce bottle, a Chinese soy sauce bottle. There's no doubt what this is.

MARIE POKRANT (Site Volunteer): She is really there to really help in times when your work is...long, hot days, and it's frustrating work. She's still, like, being the cheerleader.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Which in fact she used to be. She's always been active—the volunteer firefighting, snowboarding kind of active. And she says she's always been a tomboy—but the kind that's never been afraid to wear pink, or to poke fun at herself, or try something new.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Oh, Susanna.

There's both the part of me that can be dressed up and feminine, but at the same time can also be a scientist who likes to play in the dirt. And I've always been true to who I am, and I've always been comfortable with being, I guess, a lipstick archeologist, if you will.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: But make no mistake, this lipstick archeologist is not someone to be taken lightly. Julie's one of the first archeologists in her field to discover historic period DNA from an artifact.

She excavated this glass syringe from a site in Virginia City, Nevada.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Nowadays forensics and DNA is a household word, and I wanted to understand what the syringe was used for. I wanted to know who used it. Knowing that it came from a 19th century structure just was not enough for me.

DNA tests revealed that at least four people had used the syringe to inject an opiate, most likely morphine. They were both men and women used that syringe, and perhaps one of those individuals was from African descent. And I would never have been able to know that just using traditional archaeological methods.

And one thing we're not finding is, there are no women's personal items, and that's because we're in a bachelor culture, really.

JON ERLANDSON: She's really good at interpreting history for the public. We have to share our findings with them and make it interesting, not just blasé.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: This came all the way from China, back in the late 19th, early 20th century. And it's either from a food storage jar or....

My goal as an archaeologist is not just to dig up the artifacts, put them in a bag and put them in a museum somewhere, but to get that out to the public, people that have an interest in who was here before them.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie Schablitsky's commitment to her science is driven by her passion to understand the past, to re-construct history, one artifact at a time.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: Even little bits and pieces from a Chinese trash pit...

This is excellent preservation.

...or DNA from a syringe can be brought together to tell a bigger story.

Oh, well, good. That's a nice, complete piece.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Julie even married an archeologist: Bob Nyland, an underwater archeologist with the US Navy.

JULIE SCHABLITSKY: He's water, I'm land. So he shares my passion. If you really have a drive for something, a desire, this passion that is inside of you, don't ever think, "Oh, I can't do it." I think it's very, very rare that people take a passion that they have, and turn it into a profession. But I think it's completely possible.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: And now for some final thoughts on subatomic particles.

We learn early in school that there is such a thing as atoms and that all of matter is composed of them. A little later, we learn that atoms—a word, by the way, from the Greek atomos, meaning indivisible—are themselves composed of even smaller particles, the familiar electrons, protons, and neutrons.

Under exotic conditions of high energy, like what's common at CERN and in other accelerators, particles wholly unfamiliar to everyday life pop into existence.

But what may be unfamiliar to us, is common to the cosmos. Want to find the biggest accelerators of them all? They're out there in the universe: the million-degree cores of stars, the turbulent environments of massive black holes dining on gas clouds that wander too close, or the stupendously hot conditions during the big bang.

So while physicists probe ever higher energies to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter, those same experiments serve as a probe of what's going on across space and time.

There lies one of the most remarkable stories of modern science: how the study of the smallest constituents of matter offers deep insight to the biggest event there ever was, the birth of the universe itself.

NARRATOR: Flowering plants delight our senses; we love them in our gardens. Yet it is little appreciated that they are the basis of our food. In fact, humans would not have evolved without them.

But, for the plant, flowers are an enormous drain on limited resources, so why even have flowers?

DAVID DILCHER (Paleobotanist, University of Florida): Flowers are all about sex, that's for sure.

NARRATOR: The origin of flowers is one of botany's most enduring mysteries. Darwin called the mystery "abominable." Now two teams of scientists have set out across China to solve that mystery.

YIN KAIPU (Botanist, Chengdu Institute of Biology): Lily sargentiae.

NARRATOR: One team is searching for the clues that are held by living plants.

DANIEL J. HINKLEY (Horticulturist and Plant Explorer): Oh, my gosh! There's a lot of people that would love to be here right this moment.

NARRATOR: The other believes it has found an extraordinary fossil that could be the world's first flower.

DAVID DILCHER: That's history right there.

NARRATOR: Together, can they solve this evolutionary mystery? Tonight on NOVA, The First Flower.

Major funding for NOVA is provided by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, serving society through biomedical research and science education: HHMI.

And by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and by contributions to your PBS station by viewers like you. Thank you.

NARRATOR: Flowers hold a special place in the natural world and in the human heart. But flowering plants are not just fragrant, decorative objects, they are essential to human life. Almost all our food, including wheat, corn and rice, is derived from them, as are many medicines, old and new.

But where did flowers themselves come from?

Professor Sun Ge, from China's Jilin University, is certain that early flowers evolved here, in northern China, and he is determined to find the world's first.

Not far from the border of Inner Mongolia, there is a remarkable fossil site that is revealing what the Earth looked like more than 100,000,000 years ago.

SUN GE (Paleobotanist, Jilin University): Fossils form in between the layers of sediment. Searching for fossils is like opening the pages of a book. We look page by page by page.

NARRATOR: Sun Ge searched for more than a decade, through these layers of rock, without success. One day a student dropped off three new fossils at his office. The first two were plants Sun Ge had seen before.

SUN GE: Then I looked at the third one. I was surprised. It was a very strange fossil. I was very excited.

NARRATOR: The fossil was unlike anything Sun Ge had ever seen before. At the top of two simple branches were structures that appeared to enclose seeds. An enclosed seed is a defining feature of a flower, today. Could this be an early flower?

After months of analysis, Sun Ge decided to share it with a fellow botanist in the United States. This priceless fossil, that had been buried deep in the earth for more than a hundred million years, had to endure one more burial in another kind of tomb.

Sun Ge brought the fossil to his longtime friend and colleague David Dilcher, of the University of Florida, for another opinion.

DAVID DILCHER: Yeah, it could be. It really...I think maybe you're right, that it could be.

NARRATOR: Dilcher is one of the world's leading paleobotanists, which is the study of ancient plants and their fossils. His passion is trying to understand the origin of flowers.

DAVID DILCHER: I've been looking for the earliest flowering plant in the world for, probably, 35 years.

NARRATOR: Before flowers, the Earth was covered with green plants like ferns, pines, and the now-extinct seed ferns. Their reproduction was relatively slow and inefficient. Pollination was mostly carried out by the wind.

Eventually, the fossil record shows that flowering plants came to dominate the globe. They, clearly, were the winning evolutionary strategy.

DAVID DILCHER: In numbers of species, I would guess that 95 percent of the plants that we are in contact with are flowering plants.

NARRATOR: Flowers take enormous energy for a plant to produce. They may be beautiful, but that beauty is, in one sense, a burden. So why have flowers at all?

When and how flowering plants began has long been one of botany's biggest and most beautiful mysteries. Could this strange new fossil from northern China solve that enduring mystery?

One of the best places on Earth to see the results of the evolution of flowering plants is the Hengduan Mountains in southwestern China, which span the regions of Sichuan, Hunan and Tibet. This is the most biodiverse temperate forest in the world. But to a plant lover it feels strangely familiar, because this is where many of the flowers in your garden came from.

Professor Yin Kaipu, a botanist from Chengdu, has spent his life studying the diversity of plants in the Hengduan Mountains.

YIN KAIPU: Everyone who comes here falls in love with this place. The scenery is sublime, it's beautiful. The biodiversity is so rich. It's why most of the world botanists feel that this is a living museum of plant evolution.

NARRATOR: While Sun Ge and Dilcher are studying evolution from the ancient fossil record, Yin is taking a different path. He is documenting the outcome of that evolution through a catalogue of living plants.

How did such an astonishing array of colors, patterns, shapes and sizes evolve? And how are they related?

Finding and cataloguing plants is essential to answering that question. As part of that effort, Professor Yin has been joined by Dan Hinkley, an American plant explorer.

DAN HINKLEY: China's the mother of all gardens. Whether it be the ferns, whether it be the maples, the rhododendrons, camellias, the lilies, the iris, we're in their place of origin. Right here is where they came from.

NARRATOR: Their first stop is an alpine meadow at 14,000 feet. Hinkley barely gets of the car before he sees what makes the Hengduan Mountains so special.

YIN KAIPU: Look! Lilium lophophorum.

DAN HINKLEY: Ah, Lilium lophophorum. Oh, my gosh, the first time I've ever seen this in blossom. It's fantastic. And corydalis here. Curviflora. And alium, geranium. Look at that. Should we come up? Oh, my gosh, that's just extraordinary. Lilium lophophorum—it's the first time I've seen it in flower. The petals don't completely dis-attach which makes it so exquisite.

So, we have hardy geraniums, lilies, gentians, euphorbias. There is even an edelweiss here, Leontopodium—which in mostly associated with the Alps in Europe—a spruce, picea; Potentilla; primulas; anemones. It is absolutely staggering the number of genera that we are familiar with in the garden setting that is in this small little piece of land in front of me, that has been grazed by yak and cut for the roadway. Ligularia, botrychium, which is a fern, and arenaria, it's…spirea. It goes on and on. It's absolutely staggering.

This little anenome is quite exquisite, I think, particularly so for that blue staining on the undersurface of each sepal.

YIN KAIPU: A lily; there's a lily.

DAN HINKLEY: I'm not sure, but I think that, unless you are looking at something else, I think this is another lily. The same lily. Yeah, it's lily and… Oh jeez! I just saw it. Oh, god, that is unbelievable. Oh my god, this is extraordinary.

NARRATOR: Cypripedium tibeticum is a rare species of the much sought after lady slipper orchids, named after the unusual pouch created by a modified petal.

DAN HINKLEY: Professor Yin, unbelievable! There's a lot of people that would love to be here, at this moment, sitting in yak dung. It is just amazing to see this.

NARRATOR: Whether it be finding one rare flower or one unique fossil, they are both essential parts of understanding the evolution of flowering plants.

One of the things that make the Hengduan Mountains such a rich breeding ground for plant life is the variety of climates. They like to say, here, that you can experience all four seasons in one day. Within a few hours you can drive from mountains, where the air is damp and cold, to valleys, where it's summer and there are cacti at the side of the road.

DAN HINKLEY: It is incredibly hot.

NARRATOR: The unique conditions allowed many of the flowers here to survive the last Ice Age. In other countries around the globe thousands of species of plants were stripped clean by the glaciers. The Hengduan Mountains have, in effect, served as a safety deposit box of temperate diversity.

Half a world away there is another kind of safety deposit box of plant diversity, David Dilcher's fossil collection at the Florida Museum of Natural History. These drawers hold over a quarter million fossils and document the evolution of plant life on Earth.

DAVID DILCHER: This would be a little over 300,000,000 years old. It's a totally extinct group of plants today, but it's what made up the coal age forests.

NARRATOR: The fossil record shows that, while flowering plants evolved rather late, they came to dominate the Earth.

DAVID DILCHER: The origin of flowers is a very important phenomenon in the history of the Earth. Humans are a result of this evolutionary event. We would not be here if we didn't have the products of flowering plants to eat.

NARRATOR: But clarifying the steps of flowering plant evolution has been difficult, in part because most plants decompose before they ever become a fossil. Usually only fragments remain, which is one of the things that makes this strange new fossil from China so extraordinary. The details of the plant are beautifully preserved.

Sun Ge named it Archaefructus, which refers to the fossil's ancient fruits. But how ancient is Archaefructus?

SUN GE: This is typical Jurassic rocks with the red color. From this formation we have found a lot of dinosaurs.

NARRATOR: Some of the rock layers here in northwestern China date back 150 million years to the Jurassic Period, the heyday of dinosaurs. If Archaefructus could be proven to be a Jurassic flowering plant, it would surely be one of the world's very first.

In the months following the initial discovery, Sun Ge and his team turned up several more Archaefructus fossils in the same location. Each new discovery added important details to what this plant looked like.

DAVID DILCHER: It's nice to see this is an axillary shoot coming out.

The first flowering plants didn't resemble any flowers we know today. They didn't have petals, they didn't have fragrance, they weren't beautiful. They simply were functional.

NARRATOR: To understand why this fossil that looks nothing like a flower could be one of the world's first, you have to understand what the function of flowers is.

DAVID DILCHER: They are all about sex. Yeah, yeah, flowers are all about sex, that's for sure. They're managing the reproductive biology for the plant, and the reproductive biology happens to be a sexual process.

To illustrate the basic sex life of a flower, we can use a lily. There are, of course, the recognizable petals, but at its center are the real stars: the stamens are the male parts that produce pollen; the pistil is the female part that contains the ovaries.

Plants have elaborate strategies to avoid self-pollination, like the female part ripening at a different time than the male pollen.

When the pollen from another flower lands on the pistil—usually deposited by a passing insect—a pollen tube grows down, carrying the sperm to the egg, and reproduction takes place, producing seeds inside of a fruit.

The pretty flower, therefore, with those recognizable petals and scent, is really just good packaging.

DAVID DILCHER: Flowering plants were the first advertisers in the world. They put out beautiful petals, colorful patterns, they put out fragrances, and they gave a reward, such as nectar or pollen, for any insect that would come and visit them. And what were they advertising? They were advertising the sexual organs, the female parts and the male parts that were hidden or positioned within the center of this flower.

So if they could attract these mobile pollinators to come and mess around, crawl around, feed in this flower, pick up pollen on the legs, pick up pollen on the body, and then fly to another flower some distance away and repeat this process, they could effectively carry their male genetic material in the pollen grain to another flower.

DAN HINKLEY: It's so tempting to believe that this palate of color and form and texture is actually here for the benefit of our own eyes. But in truth, what we're looking at is simply an unfolding of the story of the survival of their own species.

NARRATOR: The story of flower evolution is integrally linked with that of its pollinators, like insects and birds. This co-evolution has been largely responsible for their remarkable diversity. It is believed that there may be as many as 400,000 different species of flowering plants, including things as different as roses, wheat and even apple trees.

DAN HINKLEY: Oh, my god. I can't believe it. I have been wanting to see this. This is mandragora—made famous by Harry Potter—and here it's already setting fruit…absolutely fantastic.

All flowering plants flower, all flowering plant that flower fruit. The fruit is the new generation, whether it's an apple or whether it's a pumpkin, whether it's this poisonous berry, it's the point of flowering. It is the renewal of the species, the enhancement of the species as well. This seed possesses that little bit of difference that may allow it to adapt, down the road, to a different set of circumstances that it might encounter.

NARRATOR: Dilcher believes that this fossil from China, while not beautiful, is the first plant to have the basic pollen- and seed-producing organs of a modern flower.

This fossil shows Archaefructus, like a modern lily, had male pollen-producing organs and the female organs, called carpels, which are similar to pistils. Inside the carpels are the eggs that, when fertilized, become seeds.

But unlike the lily, these organs are spread out along a stem. Dilcher believes that over the long course of evolution this stem would have shrunk, pulling the organs together for efficient pollination, and changing the leaves to colorful, attractive petals, creating what we think of as a flower.

DAVID DILCHER: We saw the carpals, we saw the seeds enclosed by the carpals, and Sun Ge and I knew that this, in fact, was the first flower in the world. It was a thrilling experience.

NARRATOR: Right or wrong, Sun Ge and Dilcher are in for a contentious fight if they want to prove that this is the world's first flower.

Flowers have always aroused passions, and the hunt to find new flowers or their fossils has long driven botanist to extremes.

Professor Yin and Dan Hinkley are retracing the footsteps of the famous British plant explorer, Ernest H. Wilson, who traveled to China in the early 1900s. Wilson is one of the greats of plant exploration. He led four expeditions here in search of plants for English and American gardens. By any standard he was phenomenally successful.

He introduced to the west some 1,500 plants, including new species of rhododendrons, dogwoods, clematis, forsythia, poppies, primulas and roses. But flower hunting in the 1900s was a very risky business, and Wilson's obsession with this flower nearly cost him his life.

The regal lily is a very common flower around the world today, yet its only natural habitat is clinging to the rocky cliffs in a 60-mile stretch in this narrow valley in western China.

In 1910, just after locating thousands of lily bulbs, Wilson's caravan was hit by a landslide. A rock shattered Wilson's leg in two places.

YIN KAIPU: Wilson bore with the pain and used his tripod to splint his leg. Then, from the direction of Dujiangyan came 40 or 50 mules on the way to Songpan. Wilson couldn't retreat; the mules couldn't retreat. So he just lay on the ground to let the 50 mules step over him.

NARRATOR: Wilson contracted gangrene but managed to fight off amputation of his leg. He was left with a severe limp that he nicknamed his "lily limp." But Wilson's legacy, and that of the regal lily, lives on, literally, in your garden.

Wilson's legacy also lives on at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, outside of London. Here is one of the world's largest herbariums, or library of dried plants. Peter Crane is a leading paleobotanist and the former director at Kew.

SIR PETER CRANE (Paleobotanist, University of Chicago): Inside this building we have somewhere between seven- and eight million herbarium specimens that represent the diversity of life, botanical life, on this planet.

NARRATOR: And among those specimens is the very one collected by E. H. Wilson in that narrow valley in China: Lilium regale.

PETER CRANE: It's a beautiful and fascinating plant and one of the great introductions into horticulture that Wilson made.

NARRATOR: The study of plants has been essential to man throughout human history because of their importance to food, medicines and economies. Understanding them requires figuring out how they are interrelated, which is done in part by classifying—sorting and trying to arrange them into a family tree of plants.

At the heart of this collection are the type specimens, the first plant collected of a type, the example that defines the species.

PETER CRANE: This one, in particular, is a fantastic one, because it was especially collected by Darwin on the voyage of the Beagle. And it's actually a species of gentian. It would probably have had a nice blue flower when it was fresh.

Even though it looks a good deal less inspiring than it did the day when Darwin picked it, under the microscope all the fine details are still there, and you would be able to study it, right down to the individual little pollen grains.

Darwin showed that the whole diversity of life was interconnected. What that left unsolved was exactly how did the diversity of plant life or, indeed animal life, for that matter, how did it fit together? Who was related to who? What exactly did the family tree look like?

Darwin knew that the family tree was out there. What he didn't have any means of addressing was exactly how all of these different forms were interrelated.

DAVID DILCHER: At the time of Darwin, when he examined the record of the earliest flowering plants, he found there was a time when there were no flowering plants, and then suddenly there was a time when flowering plants were there, and they were full-formed. And he expressed it as an "abominable mystery."

PETER CRANE: It's a nice Victorian word. And I think "abominable" because it, sort of, defied his understanding. He wanted to go deeper. He knew there was something there that needed to be understood. And I think it was sort of gnawing away at him, maybe annoying him.

DAVID DILCHER: Well, it's exciting to be back.

NARRATOR: Solving that abominable mystery is what Dilcher and Sun Ge are trying to do. They've returned to the site of Sun's original discovery in Beipiao, China, to learn more about the fossil's original habitat.

DAVID DILCHER: It's important, to…oh, look at that.

NARRATOR: Is the Archaefructus one of those early evolutionary stages of flowering plants that Darwin looked for? A prototype, or early test model, for the flower?

SUN GE: From this specimen, we can see the root system is very weak or underdeveloped. This is typical of aquatic plants.

DAVID DILCHER: You've got to break a lot or rock to find anything. Oh, yeah, here's some plant material, yeah.

SUN GE: Look at this one. Looks like the fish, this one.

NARRATOR: At the time Archaefructus was living, this area was a large inland lake, and Dilcher and Sun Ge believe Archaefructus evolved at the edge of the lake.

But ancient fossils can be interpreted in different ways.

ELSE MARIE FRIIS (Swedish Museum of Natural History): Archaefructus is not the first flower. It's a very interesting fossil, but it's not the oldest.

NARRATOR: Else Marie Friis, a leading paleobotanist in Stockholm, has analyzed Archaefructus, as well, and disagrees with Dilcher and Sun Ge.

ELSE MARIE FRIIS: We still have a long way to go before we know the truth about the roots of the flowering plants.

NARRATOR: Friis believes that Archaefructus shows signs of having adapted to live in the water, which would mean that it is a more evolved plant, and not the first flower. She, too, is looking for the world's oldest flower but has taken a different route.

Instead of breaking open rocks, she started sifting through ancient sediments, looking for bits of leaves and seeds.

ELSE MARIE FRIIS: We used rather coarse sieves, but then we found out that there was a lot of small things also floating away, and we then started using finer sieves.

NARRATOR: Hour after hour, Friis would sort through the fragments of plants. Then one day she saw something that startled even her. By looking piece by piece at these bits of plants, she discovered that some of them were tiny, whole flowers.

ELSE MARIE FRIIS: It was very exciting to see, of course. It was fantastic. There were so many details preserved.

NARRATOR: Here were flowers, millions of years old, that are, in effect, still in bloom. In very special sediments, these tiny flowers had turned into charcoal and were preserved intact.

ELSE MARIE FRIIS: Here you can see the petals, in white, and being three-dimensionally preserved, they keep their original shape, so you can see the position of the various organs.

NARRATOR: The oldest of these tiny flowers has been found to be 120 million years old.

For Archaefructus to be the first flower, it must be older. That kept the pressure on Sun Ge and Dilcher to prove just how old Archaefructus really was, and the doubts were growing.

PETER CRANE: There are a number of problems in claiming that anything is the first flower. One is you've got to be absolutely sure on the timing, that it really is the first. And that's not an easy question to resolve. And then you've got to assume at the same time there was nothing else out there. So you have to assume that what you found is the only thing that is around at that time. Which, of course, is, in a way, an absurd assumption because we know in the fossil record, wherever you look, that there's more that we don't know than that we actually know about.

NARRATOR: Sun Ge and Dilcher dated Archaefructus at just over 140 million years old, based on the other fossils found in this area. This put it in the Jurassic period, the age of dinosaurs.

No one had ever found a flowering plant from the Jurassic period. It was the botanical equivalent of breaking the sound barrier, and it led to its own kind of explosion.

Archaefructus graced the cover of Science magazine and the pages of the New York Times. This ancient plant had a very modern "15 minutes of fame."

LEO HICKEY (Paleobotanist, Yale University): Archaefructus surprised me because it was a little too advanced to have been…at least to fit my model of the earliest flowering plant. So I was quite skeptical of the age, of the date. And I went back and began to investigate.

NARRATOR: Leo Hickey, at Yale University, has taken another approach to tracing the first flower: a kind of scientific reading of the tea leaves.

LEO HICKEY: Leaves can actually tell us surprising amount about evolution. A leaf is the principle way in which a plant engages its environment. That's its light-capturing device, and small changes in the orientation of the leaf or the vein pattern will make a big difference in the yield of sugar for the plant.

NARRATOR: Hickey discovered that leaves have very different patterns in their veins, and understanding those patterns was a clue to their evolution.

LEO HICKEY: This is a very primitive and disorganized pattern. There is very little regularity to the veins that lie in between these thicker veins. The thicker veins themselves sort of wander around a bit.

This is a much more advanced leaf. You'll notice the veins are very straight.

NARRATOR: The most advanced leaves have veins that are straighter and efficient, like good plumbing.

LEO HICKEY: Modern leaves are just better engineered. Evolution works on an economic model. Those that can make it cheaper and quicker and more efficiently are the ones that probably are going to survive.

NARRATOR: But leaves can only take you so far in this analysis. The electron microscope brought into focus previously unseen detail of plant pollen. Pollen is far more common in the fossil record than are leaves.

LEO HICKEY: Leaves are found here and there. Pollen can be found in many, many sediments. The pollen evidence was the nice dating tool.

NARRATOR: Seeing the intricate details of individual pollen grains allowed scientists to identify the distinctive pollen from flowering plants and then figure out when that pollen began showing up on Earth. Their answer?

LEO HICKEY: The very earliest flowering plant pollen shows up in rocks, which are of cretaceous age, which is about 134 million years in this case.

NARRATOR: This was a startling discovery. It could help answer Darwin's question about when flowering plants began, but it puts into doubt the age of Archaefructus.

How could Archaefructus be almost 10 million years older than any known flowering plant pollen?

The only sure way to find out was to date the earth that encased Archaefructus. A team from Berkeley, California, and China measured the radioactive decay in minerals from the fossil site.

The results were not what Sun Ge and Dilcher had hoped for. The new evidence moved the fossil's age from 144 million years old to 124.6 million, which was more in line with the pollen evidence.

This still means that Archaefructus is the oldest known complete flowering plant fossil, but it moved it from the Jurassic period to the early Cretaceous, something of a paleontologic demotion.

DAVID DILCHER: The focus changed suddenly to the fact that, "Oh, this is a paleobotanical mistake, here is an incorrect age." And that disappointed me quite a bit because I was interested in the excitement of the early flowering plants. And even the fact that it was 14, 16 million years younger than we initially reported it, it still was the most complete, earliest record of flowering plants that we have available.

NARRATOR: In the spectacular Hengduan Mountains, the scientific controversy about Archaefructus seems much less heated. But what is happening here is revealing new clues to what these arguments are all about. The way the family tree was sorted out for centuries was by comparing various features of plants, like their leaves or pollen. Differences in these structures were indicators of evolutionary change, and the basis for figuring out where it belonged on the family tree.

A beautiful example of how to classify different looking plants into related species can be seen in the flowers that carpet these mountains in spring: the rhododendron.

There are less than 30 wild species in North America, yet more than 500 in China. The rhododendron has thrived here because of its ability to adapt and develop new species.

YIN KAIPU: Look how small these leaves are. As the Qingzang plateau rose, these plants adapted to the higher altitude. Their leaves became smaller, thicker and grew hair. This is an adaptation to prevent moisture loss in the cold climate and strong winds of high altitude.

DAN HINKLEY: Look at this rhododendron…absolutely amazing foliage.

NARRATOR: Their lower altitude cousins have evolved quite differently.

DAN HINKLEY: Fifteen inches…it must be 50 feet tall.

NARRATOR: Different as these rhododendrons may at first appear, their basic features, like leaves, are quite similar in structure.

YIN KAIPU: There's a Sorbus.

NARRATOR: In the last 40 years, Professor Yin and the Chengdu Institute of Biology have catalogued thousands of different species of plants in the Hengduan Mountains.

DAN HINKLEY: All right, Professor, if there are any snakes, you scare them away from the trail, all right? Before I get there.

YIN KAIPU: No snakes here—leeches.

DAN HINKLEY: Leeches? Great!

NARRATOR: Finding the relationships of similar looking rhododendrons is relatively easy, but classifying the hundreds of thousands of known plant species quickly becomes overwhelming.

DAN HINKLEY: There's Polygonatum here, Smilacina, actinidia—a kiwi, there's a viburnum. And then there's impatiens growing around the base, not to mention the grasses. It's staggering.

PETER CRANE: Getting this classification straight is really very, very important. It matters a lot, where they came from and what they are related to. That tells you a lot about why they are the way they are today.

NARRATOR: Just a few blocks away from the fabled herbarium at Kew Gardens, scientists have a new tool to sort this all out. Today, genetic material, or DNA, from living plants is helping to build a more accurate family tree.

MARK CHASE (Evolutionary Botanist, Kew Gardens): Getting DNA from a plant is one of the easiest things to do. You can actually do it in your kitchen. It doesn't look like anything when you can see it, of course. You are looking at millions and millions of base pairs of DNA.

NARRATOR: This slimy glob is the plant's DNA and is made up of the four familiar bases, A, C, T, and G. Mark Chase, the head of the laboratory, translated that DNA evidence into a massive computer matrix. Thousands of base pairs of DNA for each plant are put into the matrix, and then compared with other plants. The color coding of the base pairs helps to identify differences. It is the multi-species plant equivalent of the human genome project.

MARK CHASE: There were 43 co-authors on the paper. This was a mammoth undertaking.

NARRATOR: The computer analysis was so complex it required a consortium of scientists, including Doug and Pam Soltis of the University of Florida.

PAM SOLTIS (Molecular Botanist, University of Florida): The same sort of analysis is done in the animal kingdom. For example, humans and chimps have DNA sequences that are 99-point-something percent the same. And by inference then, the chimps are the closest relatives to the humans.

NARRATOR: The closer the DNA sequence, the closer the evolutionary relationship of two plants, which then allows them to group similar plants into related families. The results aren't so easy to get your hands around.

PAM SOLTIS: This part is not-flowering plants, and this part is not-flowering plants, and everything in the middle is flowering plants.

DOUG SOLTIS (Molecular Botanist, University of Florida): So we have many, many hundreds…thousands of plants that are representing the diversity of green life. You can see each line is a different plant. And what we can see on this tree is that some come out very close together. And those are close relatives. Those are what we call a closely related group or clade. So here is one small clade, here's a larger group or cluster of clades, and then so on and so on and so on, down through the green plant tree of life.

NARRATOR: Now with the assurance of DNA insight, the family tree of living flowering plants has largely been written.

The old family tree was now in for a major pruning. Roses were found to be closely related to squash, strawberries to marijuana, this meat-eating pitcher plant to China's famous rhododendrons.

For centuries water lilies were thought to be nearly twins with the lotus—no longer.

MARK CHASE: This, believe it or not, is the closest living relative of the lotus. This is the London plane tree or sycamore. As you can see, this is not a little water plant, this is a big tree.

ANDREW DARRAGH (Horticulturist, Kew Gardens): …driving me nuts!

NARRATOR: Andy Darragh is in charge of tending to a garden at Kew that is organized by the old family tree of plants, it's called the Order Beds. He's got the somewhat overwhelming job of trying to bring order to the new order.

ANDY DARRAGH: We're in this weird limbo period. I'm trying to not only do a job of gardening, mowing, edging, and weeding constantly, but I've also got to keep myself up to date. And I've also got to try and understand plant science and botany. I wish it was simpler, but it's not.

NARRATOR: Perhaps the biggest surprise from the DNA evidence is that when all the number crunching was done, one plant showed up at the very bottom of the family tree of living flowering plants, Amborella, the oldest branch of the family tree—a plant so rare that it is only found in the remote Pacific island nation of New Caledonia.

So is Amborella the world's oldest flowering plant? Not the fossil Archaefructus that Sun Ge discovered? Not necessarily.

PETER CRANE: The molecular evidence allows us to really understand living plants in enormous detail. What it doesn't allow us to do is to account for all the diversity that's extinct.

NARRATOR: Archaefructus is an example of this. We don't know where it would fit in the new molecular tree because we do not have its DNA.

PETER CRANE: So we've got a difficult problem as to how to integrate these two lines of evidence. But they're both equally important in helping us to understand the complete picture.

NARRATOR: Dilcher and Sun Ge are working on that complete picture. They have compared the leaves, pollen and other visible structures of Archaefructus with Amborella. Their analysis claims that Archaefructus looks more primitive and therefore evolved first. That is why they call it the oldest flowering plant, the first flower that we know of.

DAVID DILCHER: I don't really know that there weren't other flowering plants living in other parts of the world, in other environments in the world. But you cannot deny the fossil record. It's there. It's hard evidence that these ancient flowering plants did exist.

NARRATOR: Today Archaefructus can be seen in its proper environment, in this visiting exhibit at the California Academy of Science. Here they have a diorama that recreates life in northern China more than 100,000,000 years ago. Growing at the side of the lake is a model of Archaefructus.

BOY (Looking at exhibit): It's called arby-fruitus.

WOMAN (Looking at exhibit): It's one of the earliest known flowering plants.

NARRATOR: By being here, it is a reminder that by giving us food and medicine, fragile flowering plants did far more to change the future of our world than any of these powerful monsters.

DAVID DILCHER: The steps between the first flowers, such as Archaefructus, and the beautiful flowers in my garden are really giant steps in the evolution of flowering plants. But in my mind, I can visualize the relationship that I see in the flowers in my garden with what I find in the fossil record.

NARRATOR: Meanwhile, who knows what clues to the evolution of flowers may be growing in this vast safety deposit box of plant diversity in Western China and elsewhere around the world? Or how long those clues will last? The United Nations has declared the Hengduan Mountains to be under ecological threat from growing urbanization.

YIN KAIPU: Species have been disappearing fast. If we don't protect them, many will be lost.

NARRATOR: Several international organizations have called for an increased effort to protect this region before its diversity is lost forever to the modern day glacier of environmental destruction.

Dilcher and Sun Ge know that there are other fossils out there, that will illuminate the mystery of the first flower. They are both determined to find them. The full mystery of how flowering plants began has not been solved, but as one leading botanist says, "it is a mystery, but no longer an abominable one."

ARTIFICIAL LIFE

ROBERT KRULWICH: Welcome to NOVA ScienceNOW. I'm Robert Krulwich. And in this hour, from a number of different perspectives, we're going to look at the mystery of being alive.

After all, what are living things made of? We are made of chemicals: carbon, hydrogen—simple chemicals, you could by them at a store. But you put these chemicals together in just the right way and you get a breathing, living being.

Life is not an unfathomable mystery. Scientists say this is a piece of chemical engineering. This is a beautiful chemical machine. Now, one day, they say, we're going to build a creature from scratch—simpler than this. But the surprise is that that day may be getting much, much closer.

You know those Hollywood movies? The ones where scientists do improbable things? They mess with life, then they get a little confident...

FRANKENSTEIN (Movie): Now I know what it's like to be God!

FRANKENSTEIN'S FRIEND (Movie): You're crazy.

ROBERT KRULWICH: But what if I told you that there are dozens of scientists, right now, trying to do something much like that? I mean, they're not stealing dead organs in the dark of night or constructing a seven foot creature with bolts in its neck, but starting with dry, dead dust, they're working on tiny life forms, racing for the big prize. They want to be the first to turn non-life into self-sustaining, living creatures.

DAVID DEAMER:	We're going to have laboratory life. This is really knocking on the door.

ROBERT KRULWICH: As best we can tell, there hasn't been a completely new life form for the last three and a half billion years, not since the first act of creation. But you are about to meet scientists who say we can do it again.

STEEN RASMUSSEN (Los Alamos National Laboratory): The steps we have to take are getting smaller and smaller.

MARK BEDAU (Reed College): It's doable and it's relatively cheap.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And what's most amazing, and in some ways a little frightening, is that some of them say it's not going to be that hard.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: Compared to, you know, making the bomb or sending people to the moon, I think it's significantly easier.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Easier to create life from scratch than making a bomb?

STEEN RASMUSSEN: Yeah, easier, significantly easier. Yeah.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Why easier? Because, say the scientists who do this, life has a rough formula, and we know the formula.

So this is your place?

JEREMY MINSHULL (President, DNA 2.0): This is it.

ROBERT KRULWICH: What's it called?

JEREMY MINSHULL: This is DNA 2.0. We make DNA.

ROBERT KRULWICH: You make DNA?

JEREMY MINSHULL: We make DNA.

ROBERT KRULWICH: The same DNA that builds living creatures?

JEREMY MINSHULL: Exactly, yes.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Exactly? Do you mean exactly?

JEREMY MINSHULL: I mean exactly.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And if you wanted to order some DNA for say an experiment, a company like Jeremy Minshull's could custom make it for you, in other words, kind of like DNA to go. DNA being, of course, the recipe for living creatures, built from chemical ingredients abbreviated A, C, T and G.

So if I'm a creature—let's suppose I'm a very small creature—I'm not going to be anything immodest like a cat or a mouse, but I'm just a little, itty bitty thing, and you can spell me CCCTTTGGG. Do you have all those chemicals here?

JEREMY MINSHULL: Absolutely. And we can make you.

ROBERT KRULWICH: A bold statement.

So, he doesn't mean that literally, but right away I could tell that Jeremy and I don't look at life the same way. When I look at, let's say jellyfish, I see a weird, pulsing, hairy creature. When he looks at the same thing—at least during business hours—he sees a blueprint, a chemical formula.

JEREMY MINSHULL: Those letters carry all the information that makes us.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And while we've known for a while how to read DNA recipes, even cut and splice—genetic engineering—now, at companies like Jeremy's, they can write recipes, create genes from scratch that never existed.

So, if I call you up on the phone and say, "Can you make me something that would, in a living creature, make it glow green?" You'd know what I need?

JEREMY MINSHULL: Exactly. We would know. We would know just what you need.

ROBERT KRULWICH: This, for example, is a bottle of T, standing for Thymine.

JEREMY MINSHULL: Can I have your hand? Please?

ROBERT KRULWICH: And this is what it looks like. Here we go. It's just powder.

JEREMY MINSHULL: It's just powder.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Is this in any way alive?

JEREMY MINSHULL: This is in no way alive.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So, this is just dust?

JEREMY MINSHULL: Just dust.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Not alive?

So Jeremy mixes this dust with some liquid chemicals—still not alive—and hooks them all up to this machine. So now it's a solution in all these things.

It's got the As, Cs and Ts in bottles, tucked in here. And you just type in whatever recipe you want and the machine pumps out the letters of life. So, it'll go "C and C and C and T and T and T."

JEREMY MINSHULL: That's right.

ROBERT KRULWICH: The machine makes dozens of strands of letters, and then some other machines mix them all together, and, automatically, they self-assemble.

JEREMY MINSHULL: They self-organize.

ROBERT KRULWICH: In the right order?

JEREMY MINSHULL: In the right order.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Jeremy plugs the completed gene into bacteria, and—look at this—the bacteria glow.

JEREMY MINSHUL: Our instructions were followed, and it's making green glow.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So for about 900 bucks, starting, literally, with chemical dust, we have just made, not quite life, but a gene, a gene that never existed before.

Then will you mail me the genes?

JEREMY MINSHULL: That's exactly what we'll do.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Woooshhh. All this is just going around through the mail all the time?

JEREMY MINSHULL: That's right.

ROBERT KRULWICH: It's funny. You say...this is all new to me...and if it's that easy to construct individual genes from scratch, some of these folks say, well, "Why stop there? Why not build all the genes to make up a creature?" And amazingly, a couple of years ago, scientists created the DNA for a whole virus.

They copied the DNA recipe, then got it through the membrane of the cell, and the cell manufactured a burst of new viruses, just like happens in real life. So would this count as life?

FRANCIS COLLINS (National Human Genome Research Institute): No, it would not.

ROBERT KRULWICH: "Sorry," says biologist Francis Collins.

FRANCIS COLLINS: 'Cause remember, what you're making in this machine is not life; you're making DNA. And DNA is just the instruction book. But an instruction book doesn't actually build anything.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Ah, so it's the living cell that does the real work here. DNA by itself does not create life.

FRANCIS COLLINS: So I would say that was not life.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So, then, what is life? What exactly do you need? Well one basic definition says that life requires a bunch of things: a container, something to live in; the ability to use energy, to grow or change; the ability to reproduce, to create creatures that look like yourself; and for some, the ability to evolve.

But making a creature from scratch that meets all four requirements is much, much harder than making a gene. In fact, no one has been able to do it.

But now, scientists all over the world are working on different parts of this puzzle. One of them is Dave Deamer who's looking for clues in the distant past.

Today, his quest brings him to the remote mountains of northern California, to a very strange place.

DAVID DEAMER: This is Bumpass Hell - we are in hell!

ROBERT KRULWICH: And Bumpass Hell is on Mount Lassen, an active volcano.

DAVID DEAMER:	This is one of the few places on the Earth that we think resembles what the pre-biotic Earth was like: hot, boiling water, mud, clay...

ROBERT KRULWICH: This is the kind of place, Dave thinks, where life might have emerged the first time around. The question is, "How did that happen?"

DAVID DEAMER:	One of the great remaining questions of science...nobody yet knows how life began.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Our best guess is that life at the beginning—and we're talking three and half billion years ago—must have been made of ingredients that were either lying around on the early Earth or brought in from space on meteorites or comets. And the first life must have been very simple, just a little bubble-like container with a little bit of chemistry going on inside.

That's one of Dave's hopes today, that he can use the environment of this pond to get some primitive chemical changes going. The powder he's got here contains some basic building blocks that could have existed back then.

DAVID DEAMER:	We're going to get some of this hot water into this little mixture of organic chemicals. These are biochemicals.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Then he spikes the pool with these basic ingredients, takes a sample of the mixture...so has he created life?

DAVID DEAMER:	Nothing popped out yet that's wiggling. Ha, ha, ha.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Well, he didn't expect that, but he is hoping that the chemicals in this pond will be able to build life requirement Number 1, a container. Because Dave has already found that tiny containers, kind of like primitive cell membranes, can form on their own. He did it in a lab from chemicals he found on this rock, the famous Murchison meteorite.

DAVID DEAMER:	There's nothing alive in a meteorite, and yet the components, the organic components of the meteorite have the property of self-assembly into these microscopic bubble-like structures.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And they did it?

DAVID DEAMER:	And they did it.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So they can make mini-containers from scratch.

Then in Switzerland, they got those containers to grow; at Harvard, they got them to divide; and RPI in New York got different chemicals to assemble into a gene-like shape; and at MIT, they got a primitive gene to start to copy itself.

DAVID DEAMER:	We know how to make things grow. We know how to make things reproduce. We know how to make things evolve, in a sense, so we can do all those things.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And since they can do all this stuff, they say soon they can put it all together and build an entire living thing—microscopic, yeah, but alive.

MARK BEDAU:	We feel like we are on the verge of making a huge, new discovery.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: This is coming. There's no way...it's a tidal wave we can see in the distance, and it's going to come. It's going to hit us. There's no discussion about that.

ROBERT KRULWICH: No discussion? But what about the people who believe that life requires something more than just chemistry? What would you say to the person who said, "No, you need a kiss from God or a bit of lightning or something mysterious and magical to go from one state to the other?"

STEEN RASMUSSEN: If I want to talk about this poetically, I think it is a little bit magic. But all...doesn't matter what you look at in your life, there is magic in that.

ROBERT KRULWICH: But still, when Steen Rasmussen and all the scientists we talked to look at life up close—right into a cell—life is not a poem.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: Life is a machine.

MARK BEDAU:	It's essentially a collection of molecules. There's nothing else that's there.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: It is a molecular machine that does certain things.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And if you buy into the notion that life is chemistry, rules and structure—if life is a machine—then we can build it.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: These guys, they organize themselves all by themselves.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Steen's idea for building life is perhaps the most radical of all, because it is so extraordinarily simple.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: What we're trying to do is the absolutely minimal form of life you can imagine. It's a million times smaller than the simplest, lousiest little organism we know today. So, all the greasy stuff will sort of...

ROBERT KRULWICH: The creature Steen has designed, and is now trying to build, has no cell membrane, just an oily blob—no DNA, instead of DNA, a manmade chemical not found in nature.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: And our proto-organism grows. It swells up as it eats all the food.

ROBERT KRULWICH: But can you build something so alien from life as we know it?

STEEN RASMUSSEN: Do I believe that you can make life that is different from life as we know it? Oh, absolutely. I do believe that.

We need this guy to digest his food.

ROBERT KRULWICH: If Steen can get his newfangled creature, this homemade alien, to meet life's requirements...

NEIL deGRASSE TYSON (American Museum of Natural History): If someone creates an alien on Earth, if you can do that, there's...now you're talking. Now, I'm going to say, "I want to bring you on my spaceship, 'cause I want you to help me find life elsewhere in the cosmos."

ROBERT KRULWICH: Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says we've got no idea if life is even possible without the usual ingredients. But if Steen engineers a completely different life form...

NEIL deGRASSE TYSON: Then, all of a sudden, your cosmic kitchen becomes this place where you are testing the limits of what life is and what it isn't.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And if life can be different than it is on Earth, think of the possibilities: life, say, with no water; life in a cloud, say the clouds of Jupiter; or any life that we are able to build.

STEEN RASMUSSEN: This is a potentially very, very, very powerful technology. If we understand, if we get the key to life, if we understand and control the creative forces of nature, that's a big deal.

ROBERT KRULWICH: But if and when we begin to make life, the question is, can we control it? I mean, in so many movies, when they make life, the experiment gets away from them.

NEIL deGRASSE TYSON: My experiment will get away from me because in the movie, it got away from them? That's not evidence. But in all fairness to the question, there's no doubt that every advance of human understanding of the universe, of technology, of our power over nature, there's always sort of the other side of that sword, because it's a sword of power.

Taking that literally, do we say to folks who are coming out of the Stone Age into the Bronze Age, "Don't make the sword, because you can hurt yourself with the sword. You could cut your finger and that would be bad. Don't make the sword." But they say, "Oh, but I can use the sword to get food, and I can cut things, and I can build." If everyone throughout the history of human culture listened to the person in the robe who said "Don't go there; it is not meant for you," we would still be living in the cave.
LIGHTNING

ROBERT KRULWICH: By the way, maybe you've noticed, in the old movies, when it's time to zap the monster on the table and bring it to life, they always use lightning. I mean always. And why? Well, because lightning is electrical. It turns things on. Though exactly what lightning does is left to your imagination, because, in the end, what makes life, that's still a mystery.

But interestingly—and I didn't know this—it turns out that what makes lightning is also still a mystery. In fact, it's kind of a big mystery. Here's correspondent Chad Cohen

CHAD COHEN (Correspondent): It's an elemental force of nature and still one of the most mysterious.

JOSEPH DWYER (Florida Institute of Technology): Lightning is very difficult to study, and I think we probably understand better how a star explodes halfway across the galaxy than how lightning propagates from six miles up.

CHAD COHEN: Lightning strikes the Earth 4,000,000 times a day. And after hundreds of years of scientific scrutiny, we still do not understand the essential secret of how it begins inside a storm. That's why Professors Ken Eack and Richard Sonnenfeld and their team from New Mexico Tech are on a 10,000-foot mountain, waiting for lightning to strike.

KENNETH EACK (New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology): We're trying to find out something new about thunderstorms and lightning. That discovery I think is, is worth the risk.

CHAD COHEN: Whatever causes lightning to start has always been hidden inside the clouds, so unlocking that process requires waiting for the weather to reach maximum force, then launching sensitive instruments into the heart of the storm. It's hazardous and frustrating.

RICHARD SONNENFELD: Come on out. Let's go. Go, go, keep going. Hey, don't drop it. Don't drop it. Okay, let's go, let's go. Go ahead, you get in position, you get in position. Oh! Let's go in, in, in. It hit the ground.

DR. MARTIN UMAN (University of Florida): A thunderstorm has got the energy of an atomic bomb.

CHAD COHEN: Dr. Martin Uman is the director of the International Center for Lightning Testing and Research in Camp Blanding, Florida.

MARTIN UMAN:	It's the brightest light that we see; it's the loudest noise that we hear. The only thing hotter than lightning on Earth would be a nuclear weapon explosion.

CHAD COHEN: But what triggers the release of all that power? We know that lightning is a huge electric spark, and sparks happen when positive and negative charges build up so much energy they leap through the air to get at each other. It can only happen when the negative charge in that ball on the right and the positive charge in that metal rod on the left get so overwhelmingly strong, they cut a path through the air in the middle.

DR. MARTIN UMAN: It's like a hose full of pressure and it can't hold on anymore.

CHAD COHEN: That's what most scientists thought was happening inside thunderstorms, as ice and water particles collide with each other, moving electric charges to opposite ends of a cloud. When the charge above and the charge below get strong enough, they leap through the air as a bolt of lightning. Except for one thing, when you actually examine the storm cloud, the strength of the positive and negative charges and the electric field around them isn't nearly enough to create that big spark.

JOSEPH DWYER:	Well, the problem is, after decades and decades of measurements up in thunderstorms, nobody has ever managed to find an electric field anywhere near that big.

CHAD COHEN: Dr. Joe Dwyer is a professor at Florida Tech.

JOSEPH DWYER:	Well, maybe we're looking for something that doesn't exist. Maybe there's something wrong with our understanding about how electrical discharges get started in places like thunderstorms.

CHAD COHEN: So if thunderclouds, even great big thunderclouds, don't have electric fields big enough to generate the giant spark that lightning actually is, where's all that energy coming from? Well, here in Florida they have a pretty dramatic way of trying to figure that out. They launch rockets with really long wires attached to try to create that express lane to ground that lightning likes so much.

To get lightning from these clouds to strike where scientists can measure it requires a simple trigger.

MARTIN UMAN:	First of all, you need to have a propellant that can get this thing up there in a hurry. It has to be able to go 700 yards or so in about two seconds.

CHAD COHEN: What is this, actually? This is...is it just copper wire?

MARTIN UMAN:	It's Kevlar®-covered copper wire.

CHAD COHEN: Kevlar, okay.

MARTIN UMAN:	So, we load it, connect it electrically. When we're about to fire, switches are turned on here, manually. After that, everything is done with air pressure from downstairs.

JASON JERAULD: Okay, Casey, Tube 2 is armed. Three, two, one, fire!

CHAD COHEN: From 2,000 feet up, the wire triggers lightning with a path to ground higher than the Empire State building. And when it strikes, over a hundred million volts zap the array of test equipment on the ground.

CASEY RODRIGUEZ: Okay, Tube 4 is good. Go ahead and fire 11 when ready.

JASON JERAULD: Tube 11 is armed. Three, two, one, fire!

CHAD COHEN: The rockets are, for the first time, allowing physicists to experiment with lightning under repeatable and controllable conditions, so that now Joe Dwyer and other researchers can test an alternate theory of how lightning starts. That theory is called "Runaway Breakdown." Using this model, the energy field inside the storm cloud, that force between positive and negative, too weak to form a bolt of lightning, is struck by outside particles, bursts of electrons, which carry their own energy, very high energy. And with that added energy, you can now get that big spark.

JOSEPH DWYER:	You end up with an avalanche of electrons moving near the speed of light. Now this model will work, as long as you have one fast electron to start it off, sort of the first...the finger that pushes the first domino to get the whole thing started.

CHAD COHEN: And here's where things get really interesting. Joe Dwyer and many other scientists believe that this outside energy force comes, not from the clouds, or anywhere else on Earth for that matter, but from cosmic rays: tiny, subatomic particles ejected from dying stars millions of years ago and billions of miles away. But how do you test this theory?

JOSEPH DWYER:	We have 10 of these detectors spread out over the facility right now.

CHAD COHEN: Well, it turns out, when cosmic particles hit the Earth's atmosphere, they leave a unique signature in the form of gamma and x-rays. If scientists can detect these x-rays, they'll have the proof they need.

JOSEPH DWYER:	This is what's called a sodium iodide detector. There's a piece of crystal in here that will absorb x-rays and gamma rays, and these things are not difficult to measure.

CHAD COHEN: That's where triggered lightning comes in. For the first time, the Florida Research Center's rockets allow Dwyer to place his x-ray detectors in lightning's path. He made his first series of measurements in 2002.

JOSEPH DWYER:	A big negative voltage pulse would mean that we got a burst of x-rays in the detector. I actually didn't think we were going to see x-rays. The first plot we brought up, there was a nice little pulse that looked just like an x-ray right at the time that the lightning occurred. "Now, that's, that's interesting; that's probably a coincidence, you know? What's the chance of that?" So, we looked at the next lightning stroke—and there was an even bigger pulse—and the next one and the next one. And every one had these pulses that looked exactly like x-rays. I think I just about fell out of my chair at that point.

CHAD COHEN: Every single lightning strike Dwyer measured showed the presence of x-rays. But ground measurements can't reach high enough to where lightning actually starts. For that, you need to get instruments right up into the heart of the storm.

KENNETH EACK:	We finally have the technology to build these instruments that are small enough and rugged enough to handle a thunderstorm environment.

CHAD COHEN: Lightning is striking all around them. It's time to launch.

KENNETH EACK:	One event won't be enough. If we see an x-ray burst, and we call it quits on one event, well, that's, that's not good enough. And it's just going to take a lot of measurements to get in the right spot at the right time.

RICHARD SONNENFELD: Three, two, one...go!

CHAD COHEN: The balloon is sucked into the storm, trailing its cargo of instruments. Launches like these have finally traced x-rays all the way up to where lightning begins and have given scientists the strongest evidence yet that lightning's spark comes from forces outside the Earth itself.

JOSEPH DWYER: These cosmic rays may be the link which will connect a dying star halfway across the galaxy with lightning.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Thank you Chad Cohen. And now for our regular segment, "Don't Ask the Expert."

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said, "Whatever you do, please do not ask me about Hollywood space aliens." But we did.

NEIL deGRASSE TYSON: Hollywood? Don't get me started. Every time they put out an alien, it's for all intents and purposes identically human. If you were a jellyfish and saw the Hollywood aliens, you'd say they looked exactly like human beings. Two arms, two legs, a head, a neck, maybe they'll give it three eyes, instead of two, or antennae. They always have a face which is a very vertebrate kind of thing to have. So many other life forms on our planet, with whom we have DNA in common, do not have faces. Trees don't have faces; worms don't have faces; jellyfish don't have faces. The list is long.

You could draw from our own planet, finding creatures that look so unlike us that you'll do better tapping them as alien life forms than anything Hollywood comes up with in all of their movies. And I'm very disappointed. You know what the best Hollywood alien movie has been in my list? The Blob, the old Steve McQueen movie from the '50s, The Blob. That didn't have a face, did it? It was just this creature. And you didn't know what made it work, but it loved your blood. Even though it was a B-movie they did well.
PROFILE: ERICH JARVIS

ROBERT KRULWICH: If you were to survey, not the universe, just the Earth, you could divide all living creatures into two groups: your smart ones and your not-so-smart ones. So on the one hand, you would have your dolphins and you would have your chimps, and we don't want to leave out your dog, or your favorite cat. On other hand we'd have, I don't know, well, moths, slugs, wheat. I mean, wheat is alive, just not all that brainy. But where on this sliding scale of smartness would you put birds?

I ask because you're about to meet a scientist who thinks birds can be much, much smarter than other scientists had supposed. And at considerable risk to his career and to his reputation, he decided to make his case. And how he did it, the way he did it, that got our attention.

Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present the winner of the 2002 Alan T. Waterman Award, The National Science Foundation's highest honor for the most outstanding young scientist or engineer in America, Dr. Erich Jarvis, as he was 25 years ago in high school.

DR. ERICH JARVIS (Duke University Medical Center): Now some of you might be saying, "Well, how do you link a scientific career to a dancer career?" You know, I can do a pirouette. Okay?

All right. I even did some African dancing. Well, I won't do that... and I do that. You want to see? Okay something like...All right. Okay.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And what he learned, training to dance, was, in a word...

ERICH JARVIS: Discipline. Um, discipline is very, very, very critical for your survival.

ROBERT KRULWICH: As it was for his. Erich didn't go to one of the city's top science-y public schools, instead he went here, where they taught him...

ERICH JARVIS:	Dream big, think big, reach for the stars. Be ambitious, be bold and, uh, don't let anybody discourage you.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And by the way, you know this school...

ERICH JARVIS:	The High School of Performing Arts...

ROBERT KRULWICH: Is this the one that's been in the movies? The same place?

ERICH JARVIS:	Yeah, a movie called Fame.

ROBERT KRULWICH: "Oh. I want to live forever." That one?

ERICH JARVIS:	That's right, that one.

CLIP FROM FAME: Fame, I'm going to live forever. I'm going to learn how to fly high! I feel it coming together...

ERICH JARVIS:	And what was nice about going to a school like this...

ROBERT KRULWICH: Says Erich, is you work hard and you get choices.

ERICH JARVIS:	One choice was I was offered to audition for the Alvin Ailey dance company, and, um, I also made it into the City University system, Hunter College. My personal choice was to go into science...

ROBERT KRULWICH: And the science he chose was neuroscience.

ERICH JARVIS:	...because I'm fascinated with how the brain can generate complex behaviors.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Erich and his colleagues discovered that inside a hummingbird's brain—even though that brain is very tiny and looks so primitive—is a sophisticated neural network that allows hummingbirds to teach each other to sing.

ERICH JARVIS:	Song in birds is like speech in humans.

ROBERT KRULWICH: This was a breakthrough using molecular biology that Erich learned from her.

RIVKA RUDNER (HUNTER COLLEGE): Isn't that incredible? I'm the science mother.

ROBERT KRULWICH: The science mother?

RIVKA RUDNER: The science mother.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Professor Rivka Rudner adopted Erich as an undergraduate.

RIVKA RUDNER:	I also, I also made a cake.

ERICH JARVIS:	Oh, great.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And he spent not only days at the lab...

RIVKA RUDNER:	There were times in which he would sleep over in the little office adjacent to the lab. You don't find too many kids doing it.

ROBERT KRULWICH: ...Erich contributed to six scientific papers.

RIVKA RUDNER:	As an undergraduate.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So there he is in first position. And, all the while, she says, Erich brought an artist's feel to her lab.

RIVKA RUDNER:	You talked about the high that you used to get when you danced. That when you had a performance...

ERICH JARVIS:	Uh huh.

RIVKA RUDNER: ...you would have a real high.

ERICH JARVIS:	Uh huh.

RIVKA RUDNER:	Okay, and then you said, "But when I come early in the morning to the lab and open the incubator, and look at a plate and see a result to verify, let's say the cold transduction frequency, I get a high just like I used to get when I danced."

ROBERT KRULWICH: And he kept dancing. He met a girl, Miriam, whom he later married, he graduated and then his father died.

ERICH JARVIS:	He was shot. So he was shot while he was sitting down. Well, they think he was sitting down, near a cave.

ROBERT KRULWICH: James Jarvis was homeless, divorced. He had been living in caves like this one that Erich visited in northern Manhattan. They never found his killers.

ERICH JARVIS:	This is the richness of what represented him.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Erich's dad collected rocks and fossils and odd specimens. He was not a well man, but Erich visited him. And more than his brothers and sister, he kept that connection.

VALERIA MCCALL (Erich Jarvis's Mother): Erich has always been the mediator out of his siblings.

ROBERT KRULWICH: When times were tough, they all had to live together at the grandparents' house.

ERICH JARVIS:	...that I euphemistically called "the refugee house," because everyone who had problems in the family would live in that house. But it brought a whole bunch of cousins together, an extended family, that I basically not only had my brothers and sisters, but a whole bunch of cousins.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And from time to time he took care of most of them. This habit of partnering and supporting is fundamental to Erich, but it's not a very common way to succeed in science. Science is a "me" culture: my paper, my lab, my discovery. Erich was playing the "me" game very well, but when a problem came up that could only be solved by bringing the many "me's" together, Erich would have to choose between bettering his career or his community.

Here's the problem: this is a classic bird brain illustration by a German neurologist, Ludwig Edinger, in 1903. The names that Edinger gave to these brain parts—that have been used now for a hundred years—use Latin roots like "primitive," "ancient," not as smart as people, suggesting that birds can't learn. But if all birds have primitive brains, then how do you explain Betty the crow?

She's at Oxford University, and a few years ago, scientists put a basket of delicious meat inside this cylinder, and the question was could Betty take the wire resting there and use it fish out the meat.

Well, here's Betty and she's picking up a wire that's straight, so that's not going to work, but she's going to try. And then, jump forward a minute, she's jamming the wire against the tray wall. But look, you see, it's bent now. So she drops it in. Success!

ERICH JARVIS:	I do think that this little bird is doing this with the intent to get the food.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So she's bending it, to get...?

ERICH JARVIS:	Bending it to get the food. I do believe that.

ROBERT KRULWICH: So they tried 10 times more. Here, Betty is bending the straight wire by walking and pushing. And nine out of 10 times she did make a tool that worked.

HARVEY KARTEN: That's tool making!

ROBERT KRULWICH: Harvey Karten, a leader in this field thought, "Hmmmm."

HARVEY KARTEN: We hadn't normally even considered that birds were that capable.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Old Edinger, with his century-old bias that birds are stupid, apparently had it wrong. And if his labels were calling birds primitive and dumb, and then the bird goes off and plays chess, that leaves everybody, including scientists, confused.

ERICH JARVIS:	I would get emails from other scientists who don't, who aren't aware of the problem. Then they email me and say, "How could hummingbirds do all this complex behavior that you described, with a brain dominated only by the primitive substance?"

ROBERT KRULWICH: Now, there aren't a lot of scientists who are passionate about this, but the group that is, really is. So as necessary as it was, changing the names was likely to get very ugly if it could happen at all. It would take someone who was collaborative by nature, and might get all of these solo characters to dance to one beat. It would take, you know who.

ERICH JARVIS:	I'll do it if you guys will let me do it.

ROBERT KRULWICH: I mean that's like... that's asking for trouble.

ERICH JARVIS:	I felt that it was necessary. And it was my naiveness of a young professor coming to Duke, you know? This just has to change. It was a moral thing for me to do. Changing these names wasn't easy.

ROBERT KRULWICH: First he got them together by email and it turned out...well, it was a complete mess.

"I am simply shocked," said one. "My name should not appear," says another. "I don't want to make this personal," says one of them, "but blah, blah, blah..."

And when they got together, things didn't go much better.

DR. SARAH DURAND (LaGuardia Community College): ...people running to get the dictionaries. And then the developmental neuroanatomists were supporting this viewpoint, and then the functional neuroanatomists were saying, "No, but that's peripheral to the common understanding." So we had great, great, drama. And I remember Erich kind of watching it all.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And it is exactly at this moment that Erich's lifetime of training kicks in.

HARVEY KARTEN: Erich managed to let people voice their say. He did it in a very, very intelligent way. He knew when not to talk. He knew when to listen.

ROBERT KRULWICH: When they shouted, he did this. When they stomped, he did that. They quit, he turned; they screamed, he twirled. And by the end of the conference, with Erich's leadership, they came up with new names that everyone had agreed upon.

HARVEY KARTEN: Oh, it would not have happened. I honestly don't think that it would have happened at this time without him.

ERICH JARVIS:	It has been accepted. At least a hundred papers have been published since on bird brains. And I would say about 95, 98 percent of them—and I'm trying not to be too conservative here—have used the new nomenclature.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Now you might think that a triumph like this under his belt would have been a good thing for Erich, but Erich may in fact have to pay a price for his contribution.

ERICH JARVIS:	I get criticized for it. I get openly criticized for being too collaborative sometimes.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Erich is at the very moment in his career when his field would have him focus on his lab work and publishing to make his name. There is less reward in science for those who have a talent for leading others.

HARVEY KARTEN: I think to some degree he gave up some of the essential things he might...we...several of us felt he should be concentrating on to get his own papers out, rather than working on this. But, you know, that's a choice he made.

ERICH JARVIS:	What's most important for me is that the scientific accomplishment gets accomplished.

SARAH DURAND:	He thinks broadly to see the big picture.

ROBERT KRULWICH: For Erich, this was his big picture: the gathering of scientists to improve all their work.

The photograph that I have in my mind shows you at the center of all these people. Did you orchestrate that?

ERICH JARVIS:	Yes, I did. The reason for taking the photograph was to show the rest of the community, the scientific community, that we are in unison on this.

ROBERT KRULWICH: Ah.

ERICH JARVIS:	Okay? And then I thought about it. I says, "Wait a minute. This is not unison enough."

ROBERT KRULWICH: So the choreographer in Erich Jarvis took over. He convinced these 28 scientists, who'd been yelling at each other for the past three days, that, for the sake of unity, for the sake of science, they needed to take one more step.

ERICH JARVIS:	We hold hands, okay? And so that then even shows more our unity.

ROBERT KRULWICH: And perhaps it'll show some of the leaders in Erich's community that sometimes what even science needs is a little more art.

And a happy little postscript here: Erich Jarvis was just awarded one of the National Institute of Health's coveted Pioneer Awards—$500,000 a year to his lab for the next five years. So he took the risk and somebody noticed.
FISH SURGERY

The great Harvard biologist, E. O. Wilson, said one of the things that makes us special, "in good part makes us human," he wrote, "is that we have a deep, rich connection to other living things." What he calls "biophilia" the love of other organisms. And even if you get the creeps when you see a snake or a cockroach or a rat, even if there are animals that you do not like, chances are there are animals you love.

And then there are some of you—and we know who you are, because we sent our correspondent Rebecca Skloot to look—there are some of you whose love for animals is...well, why don't you see for yourself.

REBECCA SKLOOT (Correspondent): In this high-tech operating room, surgeons— some of the top in their field—prepare to remove a large tumor, probably malignant. One doctor tests the laser he'll use to burn away abnormal cells, another preps the patient for surgery. Meet Comet, a one-pound goldfish with skin cancer.

DR. GREGORY LEWBART (North Carolina State University): Well, we can't operate under water, so we put it on our anesthesia machine, where it's out of the water, then the tubes go into its mouth, and then the water, with a little bit less concentration of anesthetic, flows over the gills, and they stay asleep while we work on them. I like to look at his gills. See how nice and red they are?

REBECCA SKLOOT: Dr. Greg Lewbart runs the world's first aquatic medicine residency program, at North Carolina State University's veterinary school. It's a new field, so he and his colleagues are big on firsts: first fish laser surgery, first study on fish pain management. They even invented the machine keeping Comet knocked out.

GREG LEWBART:	We can do radiographs or x-rays. We do ultrasound, CAT scans; we can even do MRIs. I don't think there are any limits on it, other than what physically can be done with that animal and then what the owners can afford or are willing to spend.

REBECCA SKLOOT: And apparently, they're willing to spend a lot, anywhere from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars. But why pay for laser surgery on a goldfish? Comet's probably worth about 10 cents.

Here's something that might surprise you: more Americans own fish than dogs or cats these days. But what's more interesting is that people's attitudes about fish are actually changing. They're not just things you keep around the house for decoration anymore. These are pets. Companions that people bond with, care about.

Debbie Corpuz has 27 fish. Some are "rescue fish," ones she found flopping in a field after kids turned over their tank, or party favors she saved from wrongful death by toilet flushing.

Do different fish have different personalities?

DEBBIE CORPUZ (Fish Owner): Oh yes, oh yes. Some are like this guy; he's very bold and outgoing. You know, I talk to him and tell him what's going on, and he would, you know, come up to the surface and just listen to me. He really responds to people.

GREG LEWBART:	I really do think there is a human-fish interaction. Fish are pretty smart. I don't think we give them enough credit a lot of times. They can be trained to do some pretty amazing things. There's a book that teaches you how to train your goldfish to swim through a hoop, to fetch, to play basketball.

So I can see that mass a lot better now.

REBECCA SKLOOT: Today there are more than 2,000 fish vets. So, if your goldfish gets a buoyancy disorder that leaves it swimming perpetually upside down, someone can implant a piece of cork on your fish's back. Like a floatation device that flips it right side up. And if your fish loses a fight, there's always glass eye implantation, to make it beautiful again.

GREG LEWBART: When someone brings their fish in to me, I look at that fish like it's their dog or it's their horse. I think if they could pick them up and hold them they would.

REBECCA SKLOOT: Dave Smothers'll tell you he really loves his fish. He raises koi, the mythical Japanese carp that fill decorative ponds. Some just look like big goldfish; others are the elegant koi he wins trophies with at fish shows. They can be worth tens of thousands of dollars. But for Smothers, it's not about the money.

DAVID SMOTHERS (Koi Owner): I would do anything I could to try to help these fish, because they are our pets, and you do attach to them emotionally.

REBECCA SKLOOT: In the summer of 2001, lightning struck near Smothers' pond, sending a violent electrical current into the water. It nearly killed Ladyfish, one of his favorites. They did a series of CAT scans. Her back was broken.

DAVID SMOTHERS: The fish certainly was going to die. There was no doubt about that.

GREG LEWBART:	The decision was made to bring her to surgery, a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic surgeon. The surgeons weren't able to straighten the spine, but they were able to stabilize it using screws and wires and some surgical epoxy, or cement, that actually is implanted above the spinal column inside of the fish.

REBECCA SKLOOT: What was it that made you want to do that?

DAVID SMOTHERS: This fish would never be a show fish now, because of the deformity. I just wanted the fish to live out its natural life as best she could, swimming around with her buddies in the pond.

GREG LEWBART:	When I was in veterinary school, if someone had brought their fish into the clinic for abdominal surgery, it would have, like, blown a lot of people away. Now, if I bring a fish and wheel it through the clinic, you know, it's not as huge of a deal.

REBECCA SKLOOT: Okay, so maybe fish surgery still sounds a little crazy. But think about this: in the '30s, you were crazy if you took your dog to the vet. You didn't treat those, you shot them. And in the '80s taking your bird to the vet was completely ridiculous, and now avian medicine's mainstream. So maybe 20 years from now, your grandkids will be taking their snails to the vet and saying, "Can you believe people used to flush fish down the toilet?"
HURRICANE KATRINA

ROBERT KRULWICH: Earlier this year, NOVA ScienceNOW took a detailed look at the risks facing New Orleans, should it be hit by a big hurricane. We talked to scientists, and they said, "We now have the tools to see a big one coming, to measure its force, to warn officials. We can give our city precious time to prepare."

So after Katrina, we wondered, "Well, did those scientists see it coming? Did they know its power?"

We sent our correspondent Peter Standring to find out.

PETER STANDRING (Correspondent): This was New Orleans the last time I saw it—about a year ago. Back then, the streets of this historic city were alive, buzzing with the sounds of music and laughter, and the Crescent City was in all of her glory. But things then were a lot different than they are today.

I was here in New Orleans at this same time last year to file a report on hurricanes for NOVA ScienceNOW. I talked to scientists and emergency management officials about what would happen if this city were to be hit with by a major hurricane, Category 4 or 5. They all agreed that the consequences would be catastrophic.

On August 29th, all of their worst fears and premonitions became reality, when the killer storm Katrina smashed into the Gulf Coast and the city of New Orleans.

WALTER MAESTRI (Jefferson Parish Emergency Management): The good news is that this wasn't the worst of the worst-case scenario. The bad news is that even the best of the worst-case scenario, for this community, resulted in what you see.

PETER STANDRING: Just the year before, a state and federal emergency exercise was undertaken—based on a computer model of likely scenarios—called Hurricane Pam. On August 27th , with Katrina approaching, Ivor Van Heerden and a team from Louisiana State University plugged the latest data from the storm into the model.

IVOR VAN HEERDEN (Louisiana State University): Last one we did showed that New Orleans was actually going to flood. I then sent an e-mail to a lot of different federal agencies, state agencies, the media.

PETER STANDRING: Just as they had planned in the exercises. But the next day he questioned whether the federal agencies in charge of disaster management had paid any attention to the warnings, in particular, the Army Corps of Engineers, charged with monitoring the levees.

IVOR VAN HEERDEN: The Corps should have been monitoring the levees, and they should have warned everybody when they let go. People went to bed on Monday evening—houses dry—and woke up with water up to their waist.

PETER STANDRING: As the water poured out from the broken levees on the Industrial, London, and 17th Street canals, turning New Orleans into a lake, Ivor's dismay only increased.

IVOR VAN HEERDEN: I was very angry. I sent out an e-mail to my friends and family, you know, trying to voice my frustration, and trying to voice my pain. Because, you know, we called this thing right, and, literally, nobody wanted to listen. The bigger problem is that I don't think, under the present situation of disaster management in this country, that the scientists are really taken seriously.

WALTER MAESTRI: One of the things we forgot is that Katrina is a terrorist, and that terrorist approaches the coastal states every year. We've got to be ready to protect ourselves, with all the resources at our disposal, or you're going to see this again and again and again—if not here, in other coastal, great old cities, across the country.

NARRATOR:	In the world of birds, nearly all males rely on their looks to attract a mate. A lyrebird, like so many, uses his feathers. The Count Raggi's bird of paradise has gauzy plumes spouting from beneath his wings. Bare patches of brilliantly colored skin can also prove quite arresting. Many males flaunt their spectacular plumage in dramatic dances, as the Riflebird does. But nature does not endow every male bird with such spectacular good looks.

In the art of finding a mate, one family of birds has evolved a much more extraordinary technique, the Bowerbirds. Instead of showing off their bodies, they use inanimate objects that they collect and arrange in special ways. Many of them put their treasures on display in front of special structures, bowers.

Bowers come in several different basic shapes. Their treasures vary, too. These days, some birds even collect objects made by human beings.

One species, the Tooth Billed Bowerbird, collects particular kinds of leaves and displays them in the simplest of ways, on a specially cleared patch of the forest floor.

It's no accident that all of these leaves are pale-side uppermost. The bird clearly prefers them that way and I can easily prove that by turning one of them the other way up. That's better. Leaves of the wrong kind, and other bits and pieces, have to be removed to keep the display looking at its best. But will his collection impress the next passing female?

NARRATOR:	Australia is home to eight different species of Bowerbird. This one, the Tooth Billed, is continuing to arrange his collection of upturned leaves in a way he hopes will impress any female that comes by. No other male animal woos his mates by displaying inanimate objects in this way, except, of course, us.

He's also using music to help him set the mood.

[Bird calls]

A rival with a bower nearby listens and answers. One mimics the other.

[Bird calls]

A female has arrived.

[Bird calls]

Down he comes to his display ground. And there, he hides behind a tree trunk. He is only allowing her little glimpses, as though he were trying to make her curious as to where this strange clicking sound of his is coming from.

She seems interested. He steps up his display with a little fancy footwork and a gargling call.

[Bird calls]

It's a somewhat alarming way of demonstrating his charms, but it must presumably be the sort of thing that turns on a female. But not this time. So he goes back to singing.

The Tooth Billed's treasures are the most modest of any in the Bowerbird family. But nonetheless, they are the key to his breeding success.

But the effect can be ruined by careless uncomprehending neighbors. This Brush Turkey is looking for seeds and grubs and worms by overturning the leaves and pays no regard to the Bowerbird's careful arrangements.

But there is another threat lurking in the forest. This is not the owner of the bower. This is a neighbor, a rival, and he's not dropping by for a friendly visit. He's here to steal the leaves from this display to use them for his own. Thievery, as it turns out, is a way of life among the Bowerbirds.

Farther to the south, in a more arid region of Australia, there lives another member of the Bowerbird family with tastes that are markedly different. Instead of leaves, these are the treasures this male uses to attract a mate.

And behind them is something extra, a strange two-walled construction of twigs. This is not a nest; it's an art gallery, or perhaps a treasury. And these are the jewels that it's been built to show off, bones, snail shells, pebbles. And they have one thing in common. They're all white because the artist that built this has a passion for white. And if I retreat and have a little patience, he may well appear.

This is him, the Western Bowerbird.

His bower is the key to his success and it dominates his life. If it's sufficiently impressive, then female after female, after inspecting it, will mate with him. Each will then go away and rear her family entirely by herself while he stays here, doing what he can to improve his bower's appearance, re-arranging and adding to the treasures it contains and hoping for yet another mating.

This is a female who's touring in the neighborhood, seeing what's around. How does this bower compare with others that she's seen? He watches closely to see what her reactions are. Maybe he can add a little spice with a dance. He nods to show that pink tuft on his head. Off they go together, and another male arrives.

He has not come to steal. He's here to destroy. He works fast. The owner may be back any minute and if he's caught, there could be trouble. Hours of work destroyed in a few minutes. If a female comes by before the owner of this bower can rebuild it, the vandal with an undamaged, even if inferior bower nearby will have the advantage.

Thievery and vandalism are, sadly, the inevitable consequences of rivalry among any creatures that place great value on inanimate material things.

The only other country in the world where Bowerbirds exist is in the gigantic thousand-mile-long island of New Guinea, just across the narrow arm of the sea to the north. Its thick, rain-drenched forests were once continuous with those in tropical Australia. So it's not surprising to find members of the family up here too.

Travel in New Guinea is not easy. It rains almost every day, so everything in the forest is permanently wet. And over great areas there are no roads, only thin tracks. So the only way to get around is on your own two feet. But it's a journey worth making for here there are species that build the most extraordinary bowers, including one that uses the Tooth Billed's technique of decorating the ground but drapes the branches above as well.

In this forest, where every tree is hung with moss, you might walk straight past this bower; unless, that is, you noticed that there were blue berries pounced on this branch and then behind you, dried orchid stems hung round the sapling like tinsel on a Christmas tree. And they go 12 feet up and extend 20 feet beyond me. And then, as you walk into the heart of this path, there is really conclusive evidence of what it is. Here, lots and lots of wing cases of beetles, and most extraordinary and conclusive of all, three of the amazing head plumes of the King Saxony Bird of Paradise. They could never have fallen into this position naturally. The Bowerbird must have deliberately put them there.

And this is the proprietor, Archibald's Bowerbird, until very recently the least known member of the whole family. That yellow crest shows that this is the male. He's picked up a beetle's wing cover. Clearly he thinks it would look better in a slightly different position.

This bird doesn't have that yellow crest. It must be a visiting female. Her arrival is the cue for him to display. He seems to be playing hide and seek, like the male Tooth Billed. It's a way of drawing her attention to the wonders he's laid out on the ground. And when the female comes down to inspect them, he chases her in a ritualized way, back and forth across the floor of the bower.

But whether he is successful or not, who knows? No ornithologist has ever seen the mating of Archibald's Bowerbird.

Walking through this forest, you have to keep your eyes skinned. If you stop for any length of time, leeches are likely to start looping across the ground toward you. And you also ought to keep a lookout for berries balanced on branches as a sign of a nearby Archibald's bower. But there's one kind of bower here that is so extraordinary that you can't fail to spot it.

It's easy to imagine how baffled early European travelers must have been when they found something like this in the depths of the forest. It's based around the stem of a tree fern. These aren't tree fern roots. They are separate twigs, each individually placed. On the ends of many of them, there are pendants made of caterpillar droppings. This is a rim around the corridor made of impacted moss. And on the top of it little black objects. They're actually fungus, but rare fungus. It's very hard to find these if you look in the forest here.

And here is the owner, McGregors Bowerbird.

Fungus, clearly, in any well-appointed properly tended bower should never be found in the runway round the base of the maypole. Keeping the bower smart requires such continuous attention that the male has little time for other things. So when he does manage to get away to forage, he brings back as much food as he can carry and stores it nearby. That way he won't have to leave the bower when he wants a snack.

His reproductive success will depend on his having, in the eyes of the females, the most impressive bower around. So one can never have too many caterpillar droppings hanging on one's maypole. And suspending them is not easy.

What next?

Another twig, that could look good on the very top of the maypole.

We know that the females tour all the bowers in the neighborhood, assessing them and presumably making a choice between them. And there must be fifteen or twenty within a mile of where I'm sitting now. So on what basis do they choose? Well, they aren't judging as to whether the bird is going to be a good father in the sense of helping in the nest, because these male Bowerbirds have no part in either building the nest or feeding the young. So the females, presumably, are judging on the way that this bower has been built, how it's been decorated and how he dances within it. And that means that the females must have some kind of aesthetic sense, artistic sense. And the interesting thing is that in recent years, European sculptors have also thought that there is great aesthetic power in constructions like this.

Andy Goldsworthy is a highly regarded artist who creates what has become known as land or environmental art.

ANDY GOLDSWORTHY (Environmental artist): My art is unmistakably recognizable as a touch of a person. I am not a bird and I do not mimic the things that I see that birds and animals make. However, there are parallels to be made.

The sculptures are a response to place, light, atmosphere, the daytime. But it starts with the material. That's the beginning, and if there are a lot of branches that have curves in them, then that takes me in a certain direction. It allows me to work with the material in particular ways that I cannot with a straight branch.

NARRATOR:	Both Bowerbirds and human art lovers must find something rewarding in constructions which carry, in Andy Goldsworthy's words, "the touch of a person." And just as every human artist has his or her individuality, so does every male Bowerbird.

So, if this is a work of art, as it certainly is in the opinion of many critics, why is this not? It's certainly constructed with great care, and when you watch a male at work, it's quite clear that he's giving great consideration to the placing every one of its decorations. There may be over five hundred of them distributed around the maypole. Sometimes he will change the placing of a new acquisition several times before he is satisfied it can be seen to its best effect.

Time for a refreshment. He takes a snack from his larder in the nearby saplings.

And now he backs up the effect of his sculpture with an intimate murmuring song. A female has appeared.

[Bird calls]

He uses the standard family technique of trying to arouse her curiosity by hiding.

[Bird calls]

She flies off to one side and he dodges to the other, to keep out of her sight behind his maypole. But she's going to look elsewhere. Had she been more impressed, she would have flown down into the runaway, and then he would have launched into his full display. That is a very rare site indeed, for the females are extremely choosy.

But the owner of this bower has struck lucky. The final revelation, the full display of the crest, that until now he has kept hidden, though he still now only gives her glimpses of it. Less than one in ten male Bowerbirds manages to persuade a female to reach this stage and then copulate with him in the forest nearby. But those few successful males will mate with the majority of the females. All bower builders try to be polygamists.

Five of the eighteen species in the family build their bowers on the maypole plan and each does so in its own particular way. In the Australian rainforest there's another.

This is a rather more complex bower. It is similar in many ways to the maypole but instead of having one maypole, it has two. Here's one around this sapling and here, not quite so big, is another. Every single twig has been brought in and on this kind of bower you nearly always find that they have been glued together with a kind of fungus. And between the two maypoles there is a horizontal branch and it's there that the jewels are placed by the birds. There are lots of these translucent seedpods but mostly it's this yellow lichen. And if I put this on there I don't think he'll like it. That might bring him in and I will go and wait over there to see if we are in luck.

[Bird calls]

The forest is full of sound.

[Bird calls]

That is him. That is his scolding call. The trouble with this forest it is full of mosquitoes. I daren't flap my hands too much. That's the Whip bird. It is very typical in sound to this Queensland rainforest. That is the Whip bird again. And he's coming down to the bower.

There's the Bowerbird. That's one of his approach posts. He often perches here. Here he comes.

[Bird calls]

No, he certainly doesn't like that bit of lichen where I put it.

Back again. This time he has brought a Jasmine flower, one of his favorite decorations. There must be a female nearby. He is playing peek-a-boo like the MacGregors, only this time he is not using a sapling but a very substantial tree trunk.

That's her. She's come down to the bower.

That's him again. Here he comes.

But he is behaving very strangely. He is not rearranging his decorations. He is throwing them away. This must be a neighbor, a rival, intent on damaging this bower, in order to make his, nearby, seem better.

[Bird calls]

Sometimes you find one of these twin maypole saddle-backed kind of bowers quite high up in the trees, like this one.

This is its creator. He belongs to just the same species. He's a golden Bowerbird. But why should he build in such different positions? It may well be that all the bowers of the golden birds start this way, and they're used for so long, generation after generation, that the vine on which they're built increases in length so much that eventually it nears the ground. And it's these bowers that we usually find.

Just as some building sites in the city are more valuable than others, so it is with the sites of bowers in a forest.

[Bird calls]

The longer a bower has been established, the more valuable its site becomes. And that is for two reasons. First of all, all the females in the neighborhood would know where it is and where to come to look for a mate. Secondly, the owner of the bower has been depositing his droppings in the neighborhood, very necessarily containing the seeds of the fruits on which he feeds. So, if the site has been occupied for a long time, there will be an unusual concentration of food drops there.

This particular site has been occupied for at least twenty-two years. Two years ago disaster struck. A tree fell and smashed the bower. But did the male abandon his property? No, he did not. It was far too valuable. He simply moved a few yards and built another construction. And one, if anything, that is even more spectacular than the earlier one.

And he is back within seconds to keep it so.

The mountains of New Guinea, away to the north, are much higher and much wetter than those of Northern Queensland. And it's on their flanks and in the most leech-ridden parts of these forests that you have to go if you want to see the almost unbelievable complexity to which a maypole bower can be brought.

And this the work of the master builder among Bowerbirds. I am in the Vogelkop in the far-western tip of New Guinea and this is the bower of the Vogelkop Bowerbird. And what an astonishment it is, surely one of the wonders of the natural world. The bower has been completely roofed over, thatched with these stems of orchids. It has been built around the base of a sapling that has a stout pillar right in the middle and it's got two smaller pillars on the side to support it. The hole of the treasury is five or six yards across and what treasures it contains...or what variety of treasures it contains. On the far side, there are the black stems of tree ferns. Here is the lawn, neatly planted with moss and on it the shiny wing covers are beetles. There are orange fruit. There are these glowing, orange, dead leaves. These are the acorns of the oak trees, the tropical oaks which are common around here. Behind me there are black fruits.

This individual nearby, however, has completely different tastes. His bower is just as large and as splendidly thatched but he's taken advantage of this bush coming into bloom and has decided to try to impress the touring females with floral decorations. Like anything else in a bower, flowers, to create the best affect, have to be arranged with great care.

Only a few hundred yards away from that, a third bower, and yet another quite different display. This bird is experimenting with brown—brown fungus and brown leaves.

Yet another short walk and yet another bower, and another quite different collection: black berries, orange fruit and orange blossoms from a mountain rhododendron.

The next bower, the same elements, but this male has arranged them differently and given them a special bold individuality by placing right in the center a huge black mushroom.

As well as the ground displays of the Toothed Bill and the maypoles of the Golden and McGregor Bowerbirds, there's yet another basic design for a bower, an avenue. And to see that at its best, you have to go back to Australia.

You might think that this is just a rather untidy nest that some reckless bird has put on the ground, but in fact it is not a nest at all. It is another bower. It has two sides to it. It's an avenue bower and at that end of it is a cleared patch and just one or two treasures, nothing spectacular, just a few little green leaves. That, you may say, is not much of a temptation to display to a female but you wait until you see the bird that made it.

The Regent Bowerbird has the most spectacular plumage of the entire family. His female once again is very plain. It seems that there's a rule among some Bowerbirds, the more elaborate your bower, the less vivid your plumage. And conversely, as in this case, the simpler the bower, the more colorful the male. And since the male Regent has such brilliant plumage, he understandably attracts the females initially by perching in the topmost sunlit branches where he can be best seen.

Having got her attention, he must now lead her down. His bower may not be much but she, nonetheless, has to have a sight of it before she will accept him. And she follows.

What will she make of it?

Perhaps because his collection is not as huge as some others, he picks up particular gems to show them to her individually, just in case she's missed their finer points. He also makes sure she realizes how splendid he is personally by repeatedly showing her the back of his neck. It seems to be a family habit, shared with those other species that have crests on their napes.

She certainly seems interested.

And what about this for a real treasure? The molted skin of a cicada. And that may well have done the trick. They go off together into the bushes.

In the forests a little farther north, another member of the family builds a rather more substantial avenue, taller walls, more treasures. It's the creation of the Satin Bowerbird. He's certainly very handsome, but he's not quite as splendidly plumaged as the black and yellow Regent bird.

So perhaps it's not surprising, in view of what seems to be the rule followed by some Bowerbirds, that he builds a bower that is very much more substantial and impressive than that of the Regent. He gives the walls great solidity by firmly interweaving the sticks. Now he adds the decorations. He has a liking for blue objects, but he's also fond of green, and regularly garlands the bower with leaves. But he does something else. He paints it.

He chews up leaves and smears the pulp over the inside walls. One can only assume that the female Satin has a particular liking for interior decoration. When it comes to jewels, blue is undoubtedly his favorite—objects like this berry. Presumably, since Satin females clearly find their males' blue feathers attractive, this is an obvious way of adding to his appeal.

But his tastes are wide. He likes a touch of green, curiosities like cicada skins, oddly shaped bones and skulls and skeletonized leaves. Carrying a jewel about is a sign that he knows a female is near. She has landed just behind him.

Here she is. Walking into the avenue is a strong hint that she is interested.

Good afternoon, madam. We have a particularly impressive seed that might interest you.

Away she goes and so does he, leaving his collection unguarded. And that's reckless, bearing in mind the family's tendency to thievery. Here comes his neighbor. Robbery is certainly widespread among Bowerbirds. But not all visitors to a bower are necessarily thieves.

This, in front of me, is the work of the Great Bowerbird, which builds the biggest of all of these avenue type bowers. But it has not been produced by a single male. That is a juvenile, a young lad as it were, and he is one of a group of about half a dozen young immature males, that's apprentices, who are learning their skills by working together on this bower.

The techniques of wall construction seem to come just as easily to a Bowerbird as nest building does to other birds. But home decoration is another thing and these youngsters seem to have their own ideas. They have built a bower here in Townsville, in the municipal cemetery.

Cemeteries offer special possibilities to an imaginative Bowerbird. Marble chippings, and lots of them, that could be a disadvantage. The thing that impresses a girl about diamonds is that they are rare and, therefore, expensive. You couldn't say that about marble chippings here. Still, they could work.

You can vary them a bit—snail shells, a few fragments of beer bottles, a hair band—but marble chips are the favorite. If you can't impress with their rarity, then quantity could be the thing to go for. But shifting marble chips in large numbers is thirsty business.

Over on the other side of town, there are other opportunities for a bird with adventurous tastes. There's an army barracks. Camouflaged green is used by the modern army for all sorts of things. And the bird that owns this bower clearly thinks it is just the color with which to dazzle a female because it's assembled a whole collection of green objects here. There are foot powder packets, bits of flecks,but mostly water bottle tops in green.

But is he just choosing green because that is what happens to be around? Let's find out. He's back within seconds. I carelessly shifted that bottle. That is the first thing to put right. And then...what's that? That certainly won't do. You might think that there would be quite enough military paraphernalia here for everyone. On the other hand, stealing from your neighbor not only improves your collection but damages his.

The owner is back and there must be a female around for he's starting his display. His only bright feathers are in that small pink crest on the back of his neck.

That's her.

This is the moment to add to his attractions by showing her his crest, but at the same time drawing her attention to one of his choicest possessions. And while he goes through his display rituals, so do his human neighbors.

A few miles away there's a school. There are lots of things here for an avant-garde Bowerbird, who wants to impress the opposite sex by showing what imaginative and innovative tastes he has.

And indeed there is a bower, a big spectacular one right in the school's grounds. It's been built by another collective of young males practicing their art. All kinds of brightly colored, highly desirable objects are being handed around during outdoor lessons. But there are limits as to how brave even a Bowerbird can be.

Until, that is, it's time for the class to go back indoors.

The boys move in. There are all kinds of possibilities here. Some test the birds' lifting strength to the limit. So the Bowerbirds have come to town, and like anyone else coming into the big city for the first time, they're discovering all kinds of new visual excitements that they never encountered in their old homes in the country.

How many can you carry at one time?

Who knows what these extraordinary bird artists will do with such new materials at their disposal in years to come?

No other male animal seeks to impress his mate not with his strength, his beauty or his physical skill but with the wealth that he has accumulated through industry, thievery or artistic inspiration, except of course one, us. But in both cases it does seem to work.

[Bird calls, doorbell]

Bowerbirds and men aren't alone in going all out to attract members of the opposite sex.

NARRATOR: One day, long ago, life in a forest came to a sudden halt, snuffed out and buried by volcanic ash. One hundred thirty million years later, fossils are all that remain, and some are like nothing ever seen before. Strangest of all is a creature called Microraptor. It had wings like a bird, but it had them on its arms and its legs. It was a four-winged, feathered dinosaur, and no one has any idea how it worked.

JACQUES GAUTHIER (Paleontologist, Yale University): What's this dinosaur doing with these aerodynamic feathers coming off their hind limbs?

NARRATOR: Rival teams have been trying to figure it out, piecing together clues about what it looked like and how it functioned from crushed and distorted fossils. Each team has built a model with very different results.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: When the animal is squashed flat, as these are, well, it leaves a little room for interpretation.

NARRATOR: Scientists have argued for decades over whether and how dinosaurs evolved into flying birds. Now, they think Microraptor could solve the puzzle, but they still don't agree on the solution.

LARRY MARTIN (Paleontologist, The University of Kansas): You have just shown me the death of the dinosaur-origin of birds.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: Birds are dinosaurs. That's why they look like dinosaurs.

FARISH JENKINS (Anatomist, Harvard University): I'm getting whiplashed by two lines of evidence, and I'm going to be disturbed this evening, thinking about this.

NARRATOR: One team is about to fly their model in a wind tunnel. But who's got the real Microraptor? It's the battle of the four-winged dinosaurs, up next on NOVA.

NARRATOR: One day, in 2002, a courier made a delivery to the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology in Beijing.

The dinosaur specialist, Xu Xing, was unprepared for what he saw when he opened the box.

XU XING (Paleontologist, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleanthropology): My first feeling is, "Amazing, a beautiful fossil."

NARRATOR: It was a nearly complete skeleton of a small dinosaur, with a feature he'd never seen before, long feathers attached to the arms.

XU XING: This animal has feathers like feathers in flying birds. I thought, "Oh, we have evidence suggesting some dinosaurs could fly."

NARRATOR: For over a century, scientists have searched for the origin of birds and flight, and the evidence keeps pointing to the same improbable conclusion. Somehow, flying birds evolved from Earthbound dinosaurs more than a hundred million years ago. Exactly how it happened is still one of the great mysteries in the history of life. And the solution may be in this box.

Mark Norell and Mick Ellison are from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, but they spend much of their time in China, hunting dinosaurs.

They're on their way to Liaoning Province in the northeastern corner of China, a region that's produced some of the most spectacular fossils ever seen. It's an overnight train ride to the kind of place paleontologists dream about.

Today, it's a harsh and often barren landscape. One hundred thirty million years ago, during the age of dinosaurs, it was a forest teeming with life, some familiar, and some not. It was also a place where volcanic eruptions created a virtual Pompeii. Now the trees are gone, but remnants of ancient life remain in the petrified layers of volcanic ash.

Norell has spent much of the past 10 years immersed in the history recorded in these slabs of rock. They open like the pages of a book, sometimes with exquisitely preserved fossils inside. These are more than snapshots of the distant past, they're high resolution records of life in a temperate forest during the Cretaceous period. They're especially valuable for the number and variety of small animals they add to the fossil record: the fish, frogs, turtles and reptiles that lived in and around the freshwater lakes.

MARK NORELL (Paleontologist, American Museum of Natural History): It's the first look at a forest like this and the creatures that would live in a forest like this, where we have tremendous diversity, but it's 130 million years ago. And it's the first time we've ever had that.

NARRATOR: Victims were buried quickly in fine ash, preserving detail rarely seen in fossils: skin impressions on a reptile, fur on a small mammal.

MARK NORELL: ...wish I could find something. Like, you'll go through hundreds if not thousands of layers, and you won't find anything. But occasionally, on some layers, you'll find lots of stuff, either tons of fish or lots of insects or, if you're really lucky, you know, once in a while—I mean it's never happened in my life—but once in a while, people find feathered dinosaurs.

NARRATOR: The first turned up more than a decade ago with what looked like a feathery fringe along its back. Then came others with feather impressions that were unmistakable. These weren't giants like T. rex. Some were no bigger than crows. But their skeletons showed they belonged to well-known dinosaur clans.

They were runners, not fliers. Their arms were too short to function as wings. They were just what most scientists predicted the ancestors of birds would look like before they evolved flight: small, carnivorous dinosaurs with feathers.

The dinosaur-bird connection first came to light in the1860s, when quarrymen in Germany discovered a fossil called Archaeopteryx. It had the feathered wings of a bird, but the teeth and long bony tail of a reptilian ancestor. Some thought the ancestor might be a dinosaur.

But the idea didn't catch on until a century later, when paleontologist John Ostrom led an expedition to Montana and discovered a new kind of dinosaur. It was a lightly-built meat-eater with a killing claw on each foot. They called it Deinonychus, "Terrible Claw."

A few years later, Ostrom was studying Archaeopteryx, when it dawned on him that the skeleton looked like a miniature version of Deinonychus. He found dozens of similarities, enough to convince almost everyone that dinosaurs like Deinonychus were not only the ancestors of birds, they were very much like birds themselves.

The new-look dinosaurs made their widescreen debut as the raptor villains of Jurassic Park. Playing the role of cunning predators, they forever dispelled the old image of dinosaurs as dim-witted, cold-blooded reptiles.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: That's a radical change in the way we looked at these creatures: big, slow, lumbering, now seen as active, dynamic animals.

NARRATOR: Twenty years ago, Jacques Gauthier worked out the details of the family tree, based on changes in anatomy that appeared as dinosaurs evolved from their earliest ancestors.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: Just by using the sequence in which those characteristics appear, we reconstruct the history of life.

NARRATOR: Gauthier found that dinosaurs and crocodiles parted ways 240 million years ago when the ancestors of dinosaurs evolved the ability to stand up and run with their legs straight under their bodies.

As the family branched out, the meat-eaters, called theropods, became more and more bird-like, acquiring traits like a three-toed foot, a three-fingered hand, a wishbone and many others. Each new feature was passed along to the descendants.

Finally, a branch led in one direction to Deinonychus and in the other to Archaeopteryx and birds.

With birds nested at the top of the dinosaur tree, linked to their ancestors by hundreds of inherited traits, Gauthier says there can be no doubt about the family ties.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: Birds are dinosaurs. That's why they look like dinosaurs.

NARRATOR: And some dinosaurs looked like birds. We now know there's one detail the makers of Jurassic Park got wrong. The raptors should have had feathers. The fossils from China proved it.

Since the first discoveries, Liaoning fossil collectors have turned up feathered dinosaurs from many different dinosaur clans. All are from branches of the tree close to birds and Archaeopteryx. Some are from the same clan as Deinonychus; others are from more primitive groups like Oviraptors and Tyrannosaurs. And that means all the dinosaurs in this part of the tree had feathers, wherever they lived in the world.

MARK NORELL: We would assume that an Oviraptor that we find in Mongolia or a Tyrannosaur that we find in Montana would have also had feathers. So everywhere you go in the world, all these advanced theropods were covered with feathery body coverings.

NARRATOR: Feathers would have been useful to the ancestors of birds long before they took to the air. There's nothing better for insulation, which may have been their original function. They can be used to bluff an enemy, attract a mate or simply to show off.

But long feathers attached to the arm and finger bones are the signature of flying birds. And they were missing from the feathered dinosaurs of Liaoning. There were no clues to how Earth-bound dinosaurs achieved flight, until the strange fossil arrived on Xu Xing's doorstep.

As he examined it that first day, it looked like it could be a missing link, with a bird's wing and a dinosaur's long tail and legs. But it had something else that he'd never seen in any dinosaur or bird.

XU XING: I noticed something strange: long feathers attached to the foot. This is so bizarre. You don't know anything, any animal has this long feather attached to the foot.

NARRATOR: A two-winged dinosaur would be a spectacular find, but four wings border on science fiction. Nothing in the world today has feathers on its feet. And this was the first clue that such a thing ever existed.

Xu named it Microraptor.

XU XING: And we started thinking of, "What's this means?" And then it brings the big story about the origin of flight.

NARRATOR: The origin of flight in birds is a puzzle that seems to defy solution. The aerial skills of modern fliers evolved in small steps over millions of years, and the fossil record provides few clues to how it happened. It's one of the oldest debates in paleontology, and for decades it's been a standoff between two opposing theories.

One has argued that flight must have evolved from the ground, up. The ancestors were running dinosaurs, already feathered, probably to conserve body heat. Over time the feathers could have been adapted for flight, as bodies became smaller and the running leaps of dinosaurs evolved into the powered, flapping flight of birds.

But not everyone bought it.

LARRY MARTIN: It's always been a hard sell because with a terrestrial origin of flight, flight that originated from running fast on the ground, you're always working against gravity. But an arboreal origin of flight, where you fall out of the tree, you accumulate air speed whether you want to or not.

NARRATOR: In the arboreal scenario, the bird ancestor was a small climbing animal that evolved flight by gliding from the treetops. And that seemed to rule out dinosaurs, which, presumably, couldn't climb trees.

LARRY MARTIN: The ground-up origin of flight didn't make good physical sense, but it seemed to be essential to the dinosaur-origin of birds. And that made us suspect that the dinosaur-origin of birds was wrong, too.

NARRATOR: Fossil bird expert Larry Martin has been a thorn in the side of dinosaur paleontologists for decades.

LARRY MARTIN: People are going to simply have to explain how you can originate birds from dinosaurs, which apparently can't get up in trees.

NARRATOR: Years later, he's still at it.

LARRY MARTIN: So, if you really love dinosaurs, then my arguing that birds aren't dinosaurs is sort of like taking away Christmas.

MARK NORELL: I get really frustrated by this just because we shouldn't be having to deal with something which has been settled for 20 years. I don't know, when Magellan got back from sailing around the world, if he was frustrated, too, by people who still said the Earth was flat.

NARRATOR: It was hard to imagine what kind of evidence could break this deadlock, until Microraptor turned up. A four-winged dinosaur is a clue that no one expected. For Martin, it's evidence that he was right, at least about the origin of flight.

LARRY MARTIN: I think that Microraptor completely destroyed all hope for a terrestrial origin of flight. This is an animal that probably couldn't even walk on land comfortably, let alone run. And so you're looking at something that's probably completely arboreal.

NARRATOR: Xu thought the same thing: with feathers on its feet, Microraptor must have lived in the trees. But he's also quite sure that it was a dinosaur. Numerous details of the skeleton say so, from the long bony tail to the sickle claws on its feet.

Xu also believes it must have been able to fly.

XU XING: I noticed the feather shape. This animal has feathers like feathers in flying birds.

NARRATOR: The wing feathers are asymmetrical, with veins wider on one side of the shaft than the other, which forms airfoil contour, like an airplane wing. Only flying birds have asymmetrical flight feathers.

But unlike modern birds, Microraptor had not yet evolved the specialized shoulder anatomy for powered, flapping flight. It was more likely a glider, like a flying squirrel, so Xu concluded that gliding came before flapping in the evolution of birds. He presented Microraptor to the world as a synthesis: flight began with gliding from the treetops, and the glider was a dinosaur.

XU XING: Those feathers will change the whole idea how dinosaur evolved into flying birds.

NARRATOR: It looked like Xu had finally cracked the origin of flight. But, within days, another scientist announced that he'd solved it and come to the opposite conclusion.

KEN DIAL (Biologist, The University of Montana): We think we have the answer, and we didn't make it up. Birds told us.

NARRATOR: Ken Dial is a well-known experimental biologist and a strong believer in the dinosaur-origin of birds. He's convinced that the powered, flapping flight of modern birds really did begin on the ground with a running start.

Dial studies living birds called chukars. They can run within hours of birth, although they can't fly until they're a few weeks old. He found that long before they can fly, young chukars use their developing wings to scramble up inclined surfaces to a safe refuge. Over time, the wing beat that helps them scramble becomes the power stroke that helps them fly. There's no gliding involved. Powered flight comes first, even on the way down.

Dial believes this is a primitive behavior common to all birds, reflecting their evolutionary history.

KEN DIAL: I think you're looking at the evolutionary process through this developmental process. And what these animals do, we think, is paralleling the evolution of what transpired between the theropod dinosaurs to modern-day birds.

NARRATOR: It makes sense, unless the ancestor couldn't run because of feathers on its feet. But Dial says speculation about fossils is not enough to prove him wrong.

KEN DIAL: If we're going to live in a world of interpreting fossils because it's just fun to think of all the different things they might have done, well, that's great. It's just...I think you're stepping out of the bounds of reality, 90-some-odd percent of the time. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. You can't do it; I just don't think it's great science.

NARRATOR: Science is built on testable ideas, and it's hard to run experiments on a fossil.

But what if Microraptor could be resurrected from this slab of stone? What would it reveal? Xu wants to find out and so does Norell.

MARK NORELL: This is a really spectacular animal, and I want to figure out as much as we can about functions that it might have had and how this will relate to the origin of flight in modern birds.

NARRATOR: Together they decide to dig deeper, to see what they can learn. And the process begins at Xu's lab in Beijing.

There are now at least 30 specimens of Microraptor in China. Xu has one of the best collections, and they're going to need all of them. They plan to build a model to see how four wings might have worked. To do that, they need to understand its skeleton and the range of motion in its arms and legs. Unfortunately, the fossils were crushed under tons of volcanic ash, making it difficult sometimes to interpret the true shape of the bones.

MARK NORELL: In the best of all possible worlds, we'd make our reconstruction from a wonderful three-dimensionally preserved specimen. But this isn't the best of all possible worlds. We don't have that.

NARRATOR: Many bones are damaged, deformed and sometimes missing altogether. They'll need to work with multiple specimens, look for the best preserved examples of each bone, and combine them all into a composite that fills in the blanks in the original fossil.

The specimens have to remain intact and stay in China, so they'll use high-resolution photographs for reference.

At the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where Norell is Curator of Paleontology, a scientific sculptor starts work on a bone-by-bone reconstruction of the entire skeleton.

Jason Brougham is an artist and a trained anatomist.

JASON BROUGHAM (Reconstruction Artist, American Museum of Natural History): We had more than 16 specimens to look at, so, many of these bones, I could see from not only both sides, but from end-on, and from all different positions.

NARRATOR: Some specimens have already been analyzed in detail by other scientists.

JASON BROUGHAM: So I would just sit there with my micrometer and check and make sure that what I was sculpting not only looked like the picture but that it met those measurements.

NARRATOR: Since the specimens are all slightly different sizes, each bone is scaled to match the dimensions of the original fossil, a process that takes months.

JASON BROUGHAM: It's hard work to sit down and look at every bone from every angle. It's grueling in fact. My wife says I have a high tolerance for tedium. I guess that might be true.

NARRATOR: By chance, Microraptor is also under investigation at the University of Kansas. Larry Martin and David Burnham have built their own model based on a single specimen and a unique method of preparation.

DAVID BURNHAM (Paleontologist, The University of Kansas): The specimen was found with this side exposed. I embed it in optically clear plastic; I flip it over; I clean down through the matrix on this side, exposing the skeleton from the other side, ending up with a specimen that can be examined from both sides.

NARRATOR: Burnham made molds of each side of the slab, cast the exposed bones and cut out the pieces. Some had good preservation, and some were crushed. When he assembled the bones, the result looked more like a crocodile than a dinosaur.

DAVID BURNHAM: What really surprised me, when I was mounting this skeleton is when I put the back leg into the hip socket, it just popped right into joint. And as you can see, when that happened the leg was mounted in a sprawled posture. The only time it felt like it was in socket was in this position, splayed out.

NARRATOR: A sprawling Microraptor is the smoking gun Martin has been looking for all these years, to prove that dinosaurs were not the ancestors of birds.

All dinosaurs have hip joints that support the legs more or less straight under the body. It's one of their defining characteristics. Sprawling posture is the signature of more primitive reptiles, including the earliest common ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs.

Martin has long believed that birds arose directly from these pre-dinosaur reptiles, making them distant cousins, not direct descendants of dinosaurs. And he says Microraptor's primitive sprawl proves him right.

LARRY MARTIN: You have just shown me the death of the dinosaur-origin of birds.

NARRATOR: News of Martin's latest salvo in the bird-origin debate does not surprise Mark Norell.

MARK NORELL: People who are on the other side of it creatively reinterpret all new evidence that's put into it, to fit their own thing. You know, I knew that they would still be at it for years to come. And they are.

NARRATOR: And, as for the sprawling Microraptor skeleton?

MARK NORELL: I haven't seen it. I don't know. Beyond that, though, I would question whether, if that's true, that it actually is Microraptor, because I have seen definitive Microraptor specimens.

NARRATOR: Those are the ones the American Museum team has used for its reconstruction.

JULIA CLARKE (Paleontologist, American Museum of Natural History): The primary specimen is not particularly well preserved, but did you look at other ones?

One interesting thing with this process has been to see the artist take those fossils and render these often flattened elements into three dimensions. But you have to have a great relationship of trust and collaboration between scientists and artists to really have those three-dimensional representations, kind of, be trustworthy and accurate.

So we're articulating the whole hind limb from these elements, is that correct?

JASON BROUGHAM: Yeah.

NARRATOR: Norell doubts that Microraptor was anything other than a typical dinosaur with legs straight under the body. But for a second opinion, they send the bones to Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.

Anatomists Farish Jenkins and Steve Gatesy are specialists in the function of limbs and joints in fossil animals.

In his first paper, Xu himself assumed that Microraptor would have to splay its legs out to the side to form the rear wings. But Jenkins says that doesn't fly.

FARISH JENKINS: It's just...it anatomically is not possible given this limb. You can see the articular relationships, there's no question about it. This is a normal hip socket, and here's a good, well-developed femoral head. And in a normal standing position, it would be about like that. You can abduct the femur away from the body—that would be normal—but if you reach about 45 degrees, you begin to hit bone on bone, the femur on the pelvis. So, beyond 45 degrees, this trochanter here acts as a lever, and out she comes.

STEVE GATESY (Anatomist, Brown University): It just has to come out.

FARISH JENKINS: It has to come out. This animal doesn't work like the cover showed it to work.

NARRATOR: Xu didn't have the benefit of the three-dimensional model when he wrote the paper, and he concedes that he was probably wrong about the posture. He never questioned the dinosaur-origin of birds, and upright posture makes sense for the ancestor, given that all birds are built the same way.

But back in Kansas, Martin and Burnham are standing by their conclusion that Microraptor was a flat out sprawler, and that this puts the ancestry of birds outside of dinosaurs.

LARRY MARTIN: Microraptor is absolutely deadly to the dinosaur-origin of birds. Wasn't even a biped; it was quadrupedal. It was on all fours. And it was arboreal, and that probably couldn't be a dinosaur.

NARRATOR: They think the evidence is clear.

DAVID BURNHAM: When I put this leg into the hip, you know, I can visually look at it and determine where it fits. But there's a certain tactile sensation, and I can feel when this bone plugs into the socket.

NARRATOR: So which model is more reliable? The cast made directly from a fossil? Or the sculpture based on 16 specimens?

DAVID BURNHAM: My criticism of the sculpting method is that somebody is carving that. You know, they're, they may miss a little process or a little bump, or a little shape that the computer doesn't think's important or the artist doesn't think's important. And it's probably not even a scientist themselves that is sculpting these things. It's usually done by artists.

JASON BROUGHAM: Granted, it's a sculpture. It's a hand-made, you know, piece of art. But it was held to pretty high standards, you know, and very exacting measurement. And it was crosschecked against multiple specimens. As far as it being a subjective process, well, if you think that measuring, you know, bones, down to the hundredth of a millimeter is subjective, you should have been where I was, you know, for all those months working on it.

NARRATOR: In a final showdown, Martin and Burnham examine the sculpted bones from the American Museum team.

LARRY MARTIN: The only difference from our pelvis is this area right here. You see what they've done. This is pushed in. I would argue that this is fudged for vertical posture as much as you could possibly do it, and you still don't have it. Now, let's see if they can get.... Guess what? They can't sprawl. If they try to sprawl it, it pulls all the way out. I'll be doggone!

NARRATOR: At Harvard, Farish Jenkins looks at Martin and Burnham's cast.

FARISH JENKINS: What we've got is a very well preserved femur in three-dimensional preservation. So this is preserved quite well. That's not the case here. This pelvis has been crushed. It's been squashed, actually flat, and made much more shallow by this crushing. And so, if I fit the femoral head in there it doesn't even fit all the way into the socket. There's not enough socket left. Now even if you tried to splay the leg on this animal, the femoral head is now out of the socket. So even in this deformed specimen, there is no evidence that the animal could put the hind limb in a horizontal plane. It simply doesn't work.

NARRATOR: Neither side trusts the other's evidence, so the standoff continues. And with crushed fossils as the starting point, people are more likely to believe what they already believe.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: When the animal is squashed flat, as these are, well, it leaves a little room for interpretation. And then, so I said before, science is objective, but people are scientists, and they aren't.

NARRATOR: Still, the question remains, if Microraptor couldn't splay its hind limbs, how did it use its leg feathers in flight?

A wing deflects the air flowing over the upper surface, creating lower pressure above than below, which generates the lift necessary for flight. Microraptor could spread its forelimbs out to the side to make an aerodynamic wing, just as birds do. But if the hind limbs couldn't do the same thing, what did they do?

JACQUES GAUTHIER: They certainly can't flap with their hind limbs. It has the same hook-up as you do. It goes up vertically and goes 90 degrees and goes into your, into your hip bone. Can you flap your hind leg in that direction? Try sticking your leg out in that direction and see what you do to it, you know. So yeah, there are these feathers hanging off of it and they're aerodynamic. What are they doing?

NARRATOR: Jenkins and Gatesy can't figure it out.

FARISH JENKINS: Well let's just try to put this together. And you've got a wing that's shooting down. How's that work?

STEVE GATESY: And we can lengthen it, shorten it. I don't even know whether we can turn it this way or this way.

FARISH JENKINS: This is very problematic. Coming off the back? You've got to be mad!

STEVE GATESY: That's what I see, right?

NARRATOR: Martin and Burnham think they have the answer.

LARRY MARTIN: Microraptor has a fully developed wing on its hind legs. And what that means is the hind legs have to be able to sprawl.

FARISH JENKINS: There is anatomically, simply put, no way that it could elevate the hind limb into a horizontal position.

NARRATOR: The question is, "Could it fly any other way?"

One way to find out is to create a model that can be flown in a wind tunnel to see how it performs. And for that they'll need more than a skeleton.

Jason Brougham builds up the body form one muscle at a time, guided by published science on dinosaur anatomy. To estimate the animal's mass and center of gravity, the sculpture is CAT-scanned and computer-modeled with internal organs.

Mick Ellison reconstructs the feathering of the wings and tail. He traces the feather impressions from eight different specimens, scales them to the same size, then makes a composite that combines all the information from all the fossils and reveals the shape of the wings.

Then model-builders John Allen and Hall Train take the knowledge accumulated by the science team—the arrangement of feathers on the wings, the range of motion in the limbs, the body shape, its mass and center of gravity—and build a jointed, feathered model that can be posed in the various postures it might have used in flight.

It all comes together at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Wright Brothers wind tunnel. It's been the scene of some unusual experiments, but never anything quite like this.

Some of the world's leading figures in paleontology, biomechanics, aerodynamics and scientific reconstruction have come together for a rare collaboration. The aerodynamics crew from Brown University, led by Kenny Breuer, specializes in natural flight and gliding.

This is their first experience with a dinosaur. And it's the first experience anyone's had with four wings.

STEVE GATESY: I have colleagues that work only on living animals that say, "I can't even understand the living animal sitting in front of me. What makes you think you could make sense of this fossil?" And yet, you know, how could not want to try.

NARRATOR: Xu Xing has the most at stake. He's claimed that Microraptor was a link between dinosaurs and flying birds. But he needs to show how four wings could work without splaying the legs.

XU XING: Those feathers must be related to flight in some ways. But some people disagree.

NARRATOR: Norell, for one, is reserving judgment until he sees some hard evidence.

MARK NORELL: I'm fairly conservative in the way that I interpret behaviors of extinct animals. I wouldn't say that we know that Microraptor even was a glider, let alone a flyer. I mean, I don't think we know that.

NARRATOR: Birds fly with a complex wing beat that propels them through the air and also produces lift. But gliders, like flying squirrels, get the energy to generate lift from falling. The more lift they produce, the longer the glide path, and the farther they can travel before they have to land.

Assuming that Microraptor was a glider, they'll test the hind limbs in different postures to see what, if anything, works best. They decide to start with something simple: legs down and spread as wide as they go.

FARISH JENKINS: This is what we're here for, right?

MICK ELLISON: This is the one. This is the one. This is one my money's on.

FARISH JENKINS: You're money's on this one?

MICK ELLISON: Yeah, like a betting game, yeah.

FARISH JENKINS: And I bet you're a big bettor too.

KENNY BREUER: Is that ready?

ARNOLD SONG: Yeah, we're ready.

KENNY BREUER: Yep, okay. This was one kilogram, so the lifting force is about 10 newtons, right?

HALL TRAIN (Model Maker): The legs are really stable.

FARISH JENKINS: Yeah, they're very stable.

DICK PERDICHIZZI: That's 10 meters a second.

FARISH JENKINS: That looks good. That looks like a natural glider.

NARRATOR: In the wind tunnel, the model is mounted on a sensor that measures the forces produced by air flowing over the wings, including the lift that keeps the flier aloft and the drag that slows it down.

During each test, they'll gradually raise the angle of the wing into the airflow, which produces more lift but also more drag.

KENNY BREUER: So the blue dots on the left curve is the lift.

NARRATOR: The data shows up in the control room on a graphic display. The blue dots indicate the amount of lift being generated, and the red triangles are the drag. The higher the lift climbs, relative to drag, the farther Microraptor could glide in that position.

FARISH JENKINS: I like the way these data come in. They're fun. It's kind of like watching the horses.

KENNY BREUER: I was going to say it's like slow-motion horseracing.

FARISH JENKINS: Kiss three, baby, kiss three. Get up. Get up.

KENNY BREUER: Now, I think this is significantly plummeting to the ground.

FARISH JENKINS: Oooh!

JOE BAHLMAN (Biologist, Brown University): That's a lot of drag. That's going to give it a nice...it's still going to slow its fall.

FARISH JENKINS: Smarty pants!

NARRATOR: With too much drag and not enough lift, the best it could do in this position is not much better than parachuting. A variation with the legs tucked up under the body isn't any better.

It could produce more lift if it flew faster, forcing more air over the wing. But gliders can't generate their own power.

KENNY BREUER: Okay, so we're ready to try a new posture, right?

NARRATOR: The front wing doesn't provide enough lift on its own, so the hind limbs will have to contribute somehow.

One possibility is to form a second set of wings with the leg feathers straight back and the foot feathers spread horizontally, something like an old fashioned biplane.

JOE BAHLMAN: If you look at it like this, I mean, it's clearly a second lifting surface.

NARRATOR: It could be the only way to get more wing area without splaying the legs. If it doesn't work, Xu's dinosaur might not be much of a flier after all.

KENNY BREUER: Right, but the wing is pushed forward.

FARISH JENKINS: That next one, at 2.90, will be almost at 3.

NARRATOR: But the early returns are good.

FARISH JENKINS: Look at that, huh? Almost at 3 already. We're coming out of the gate fast.

NARRATOR: It looks like four wings are better than two.

JOE BAHLMAN: We may have a winner then.

FARISH JENKINS: That's it.

KENNY BREUER: So this is actually a fairly stable configuration. I mean this would be a pretty good way to travel.

NARRATOR: The biplane generates enough additional lift to produce a longer, slower, more gradual descent, but still not enough to travel very far. Moving the legs forward is worse, and causes the body to pitch, nose up.

If Microraptor were a full-time glider, it would need a way to extend its range through the air.

XU XING: I'm not sure, but this is just a kind of a possibility.

NARRATOR: Xu Xing has been holding back so far, but now he pitches an idea of his own. It's a bit unorthodox, and takes a while to sink in.

XU XING: It goes towards the tail.

NARRATOR: But eventually they come around.

FARISH JENKINS: Well, why didn't you say this earlier? This is a very bright idea.

NARRATOR: Xu's idea is to extend the legs almost straight back, allowing the leg and foot feathers to form a canopy over the tail.

FARISH JENKINS: That's your hypothesis?

XU XING: It's a possibility.

KENNY BREUER: It's possible. But that would not be a lifting surface.

FARISH JENKINS: Boy that's an interesting one. This is it. Let's see. This is it.

NARRATOR: Once again, all eyes are on the lift numbers.

FARISH JENKINS: Starting low, 1.12.

KENNY BREUER: That canopy's not necessarily a lifting surface. I mean you really have to have an airfoil to make a lifting surface.

FARISH JENKINS: Get up!

I like the drag staying low.

KENNY BREUER: Yeah. If it did leap out of a tree, that would be its initial posture, right? It would push off with its hind feet, and they'd be behind. So it would sort of dive and that would be a diving maneuver.

FARISH JENKINS: 3.42.

NARRATOR: Now the lift starts to climb.

FARISH JENKINS: 3.51.

XU XING: Wow.

FARISH JENKINS: Almost close to 4.

KENNY BREUER: That's amazing. So I take back everything I said about it not acting like an airfoil. It's acting like an airfoil in the back.

JOE BAHLMAN: This is the highest lift and the lowest drag.

FARISH JENKINS: I realized this. I kept telling you this.

KENNY BREUER: I know you did.

FARISH JENKINS: You win. Congratulations! You're all right! Nice going! Beautiful, beautiful glide, huh? It worked! It works in that position. That's the off-the-branch position. That's fantastic! You called it.

NARRATOR: Xu's posture makes for a long, fast glide. But when it's time to stop, it needs help. And that could be where the biplane comes in.

JOE BAHLMAN: So, if this animal jumps off of a tree, as it jumps, its legs are already behind it. It's able to dive; it's got a nice glide ratio going. And then when it gets ready to land, it can start bringing its legs gradually forward, through those biplane configurations. And then, as it brings its legs all the way forward, it's able to pitch up and land on a tree. So, the ultimate glide story is going to be this transition from the legs all the way back, to the legs all the way forward, which gets you very nicely from the top of the tree to the bottom of the next tree.

NARRATOR: The experiment says that Microraptor could glide very well without splaying its legs. But does that mean bird-flight evolved through gliding from the trees down?

Microraptor belongs to the clan of dinosaurs that includes Deinonychus, and it's close to the branching point that leads to birds, which means it might represent the body plan of the common ancestor from which both lines evolved. If so, then bird flight probably did arise from four-winged dinosaurs gliding from the treetops. And Deinonychus could be the dinosaur version of an ostrich, the flightless descendant of a flying ancestor.

But if another dinosaur is found to be even closer to the branching point, and it was not a four-winged glider, then flight could have evolved twice, one line leading to birds and another to Microraptor, making four wings a side branch on the tree of life.

KEN DIAL: This is not a ladder; this is a bush with twigs that branch out in different directions. And some of them are, in fact, terminal buds.

NARRATOR: Over millions of years of evolution, feathered dinosaurs could have experimented with flight in different ways, with some becoming flightless again and some going extinct.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: And they all might have been perfectly adequate. This Microraptor may have been a better flyer than an Archaeopteryx, but for whatever reason they went extinct, either by chance or because they weren't as good a flyer.

When you look at all these efforts to make the early flying machines, there are some pretty weird-looking contraptions in there. But that same sort of thing went on, you know, in the evolution of the biological flight in dinosaurs.

NARRATOR: If Microraptor proves to be a dead-end, then all bets are off on whether flight evolved from the ground, up or the trees, down.

JULIA CLARKE: We don't have a lot of other fossils that can speak to that question right now. Microraptor is a fine candidate. It's also one of our only candidates.

NARRATOR: Ken Dial may be right that young birds show how it all began, scrambling to safety with their proto-wings. Or more fossils like Microraptor could prove Martin and Burnham right about flight evolving from arboreal gliders, though they'll need more evidence than that to persuade other scientists that those gliders were not dinosaurs.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: This is a question about the origin of flight, not the origin of birds. Those are separate issues. We should have the dinosaurs getting in trees first or running off the ground first, but they're still dinosaurs that are doing this, feathered dinosaurs.

NARRATOR: We still don't know exactly how it happened, but Microraptor is changing the way people think about the origin of flight.

JULIA CLARKE: Microraptor has thrown our understanding into a new and productive chaos. It doesn't solve the problem. It doesn't give us an answer. But it gives us another way of thinking about the data. And, I think, eventually, we are going to get to some answers.

NARRATOR: Microraptor is a creature no one expected, but we know of only a tiny fraction of the dinosaurs that once lived. More than 400,000 species may have come and gone in their 175-million-year history. To date, we've found only 1,100, not counting the ones that are still with us today, long after the extinction of their ancestors.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: After the asteroid hit, 65 million years ago, the only dinosaurs that came out of it are today's birds. They seem to have survived it well enough. There are 10,000 living species, only about 4,000 mammals, so still the age of dinosaurs.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Hi, it's Neil again. You ever wonder what would happen if you dug a hole from one side of the Earth, through the center, out the other side and then jumped in?

Before we show you, a few disclaimers: if there was any air in the hole, air resistance would slow me down, so let's ignore that. Earth's molten core is 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit. On the way past, you'd simply be vaporized. So let's ignore that, too. We would also have to ignore Earth's spin, which would make me ricochet from side to side down the hole. And please don't try this experiment on the actual Earth.

All right, here we go!

I fall, gaining speed as Earth's mass pulls me towards the center. Fourteen minutes into my fall, halfway to the center, I've accelerated to more than 15,000 miles an hour. Here, there's only half the force of gravity than on the surface, so I'm still gaining speed, but at a slower rate than when I first jumped in. Twenty-one minutes into my fall, and I'm at the center of the Earth, going my fastest, about 18,000 miles an hour.

As I pass the center, gravity now works against me, slowing me down. And by the time I make it halfway between the core and the other side of the Earth, I'm back down to about 15,000 miles an hour. It'll take only 42 minutes to make the entire trip to the other side. At which point, I'll slow to a full stop.

Just like when I started, all of Earth's mass will pull me back towards the core. Unless somebody catches me, I'll fall down the hole again and yo-yo back and forth forever.

Thank you!

MAN: No problem.

NARRATOR: Long ago, voyagers in the Indian Ocean chanced upon a large, floating object of mysterious origin. Its suggestive feminine shape launched many a sailor's fantasy. Some believed this was the forbidden fruit that tempted Adam, and somewhere nearby must be the original Garden of Eden.

Eventually, the exotic seed was discovered on a gigantic female palm tree known as the "coco de mer." Like Eve, she too must have an Adam, the male coco de mer palm with its giant pollinating appendage. This tree is a vestige from the vanished world of the dinosaurs; and it shares the forest with other Jurassic-aged giants, dwarfs and many other bizarre forms of life.

This lost world is hidden in a cluster of islands called the "Seychelles." Tiny specs of land a thousand miles from anywhere, the Seychelles lie in the middle of the Indian Ocean between Africa and India. These remote islands conceal an astonishing array of life and are a refuge for strange creatures found nowhere else on Earth. How this living paradise came to be is an extraordinary tale.

NARRATOR:	In the middle of the Indian Ocean lies the Seychelles, a remote group of islands that pose a baffling puzzle.

Deep in the misty uplands of one island hides a tiny creature that should not be there. The pygmy piping frog is one of the smallest vertebrates on earth. The adult frog is not much larger than an ant. Unlike most amphibians, this frog lays its eggs on dry land. Enclosed in these watery egg cases, the babies go through the entire tadpole stage before they hatch.

On a small rocky island with few fresh water pools this is an advantage. After three to four weeks the bubble bursts and a fully formed frog emerges in miniature.

But frogs rarely colonize ocean islands. These amphibians are delicate. The salt, sun and heat of an accidental ocean voyage would surely kill them. So how did they get here?

The frogs, and the other curious creatures that inhabit these secluded islands, have long been a mystery. The tiger chameleon's closest relatives are found in Africa. Disguised as the foliage, the leaf insect is almost invisible. This insect's nearest ancestors come from Asia. Both are masters of camouflage, perfectly adapted to their environment.

The chameleon's disguise and time-tested strategies ensure a meal is never far out of reach. Its eyes rotate independently, allowing it to see in two directions without having to move its head. Poised, at just the right moment its spring-loaded tongue shoots out and reels in its unwitting victim.

The presence of an African chameleon here, on a distant outpost in the Indian Ocean, is as remarkable as the presence of this exotic plant. The pitcher plant's closest cousins are in Malaysia.

To survive on rocky outcrops with little soil and few nutrients, the pitcher plant has evolved an ingenious method to supplement its diet. The plant secretes a sugary nectar that lures an unsuspecting fly. It proves to be a fateful slip. Slowly drowning in the lethal digestive juices, this fly has no chance of escape.

These mosquito larvae are somehow immune to the plant's toxic water. It's a perfect nursery—safe, with a steady supply of food. The larvae pay their way by helping the host plant to digest its catch.

A hungry skink is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the pitcher plant and its pantry of ready-made insect meals.

So how could a plant whose closest relatives are in the Orient and creatures with distant cousins in Africa and Asia all end up here together on a remote group of islands, a thousand miles from the nearest mainland?

The search for an answer begins with the rock. These time-eroded formations are granite, a type of bedrock usually found on continents. But here, far from any continent, are the Seychelles, the only islands in the middle of an ocean made of solid granite.

The secret of their origin stretches far back in time. Two hundred million years ago the earth was divided into two great landmasses, Laurasia and Gondwana. The southern super-continent Gondwana included present-day Africa and India. Then during the middle of the Jurassic period, Gondwana began to split up. The sea filled a rift between Africa and India to form the early Indian Ocean. Then India broke from Madagascar and began to drift northward.

About 65 million years ago, fragments of the ancient landmass were torn off, leaving behind the central granite islands of the Seychelles.

These peaks are the highest points on a now submerged remnant of ancient continent. On the largest of these granite islands are surviving relics from the lost world of Gondwana.

This forest is a living Jurassic Park of palms. The trees are direct descendants from an age when the dinosaurs roamed and all life grew much bigger. In this age-old forest one palm tree reigns supreme.

The extraordinary coco de mer holds the record for the largest leaf and the biggest seed in the entire plant kingdom. So rare, early sailors thought they came from a tree growing beneath the ocean. The mysterious nuts came to be called coco de mer or "coconut of the sea."

Since only the hollow rotten nuts float, these palms never spread to new shores. One of the coco de mer's last remaining strongholds is a large grove on this granite island. Here, the trees can grow up to a hundred feet tall in the sheltered quiet of this ancient valley.

The male coco de mer tree boasts an enormous catkin, which can grow to more than five feet in length. This male reproductive organ is so large it supports its own mini-ecosystem. The ripe pollen-laden flowers are a magnet for visitors of all kinds. The giant white slug's only home is on these catkins. The day gecko also spends most of its life here, feasting on the rich supply of pollen. Microscopic hairs on its feet help it cling to almost any surface. Topside or bottom, no area of the catkin is beyond reach.

No one knows whether it is one of these creatures or the wind that carries pollen to the female coco de mer. An old Seychelles legend says the trees consummate their union by swaying together on stormy nights. However it occurs, it is the start of something big.

Once the female tree is pollinated, it takes seven years for the nuts to mature. A single nut can weigh in at 40 pounds. Too large to be carried away by a bird and too heavy to float, a fertile coco de mer seed never left this Eden until humans came.

Now park rangers must tightly control the harvest of the nuts to safeguard a future for these ancient palms.

Stripping away the outer husk reveals the curiously shaped seed inside. The double lobes of the coconut account for its suggestive appearance. When sold, these so-called "love nuts" will help pay for the preservation of this unique nature reserve.

Today tourism in the Seychelles is carefully managed to preserve the islands' precious natural heritage. The highlight of any trip is a visit to the smaller, undeveloped granite islands, which are a haven for rare and unusual species.

Separated for generations from their mainland ancestors, many birds have evolved into new forms found only on these islands. One bird, the magpie robin, seems to have adapted its behavior to take advantage of the tourist activity. The visitors' footsteps stir up leaf litter, exposing the insects hiding underneath. The robin tags along behind, cleaning up as it goes.

But whose trail did the robin follow before the people arrived? This hulking creature—the giant tortoise. Weighing more than 600 pounds, the lumbering tortoise plows up the soil, exposing beetles, worms and other treats for the foraging robin.

The Seychelles magpie robin is one of the rarest birds in the world. Fewer than 100 individuals now remain. A tame ground feeder, this bird had few predators until the arrival of humans—and the cats and rats that came with them. The tortoise and the robin struggle to maintain a fragile hold on their island home.

Another critically endangered bird is the black paradise flycatcher. The male shakes his long tail feathers and calls in an attempt to attract a mate, but the female flycatcher is busy with other things. She is looking for insects and collecting spiders' webs. The spider's web silk is a strong nest-building material. She uses the sticky silk to help bind the nest into a neat cup.

The Seychelles blue pigeon is another island original. It feeds voraciously on fruit, which it swallows whole.

The tourists are only the latest in a long list of new arrivals. Outsiders have always come to these shores, joining the original descendants of Gondwana. Aerial migrants fly thousands of miles to congregate in large seabird colonies, while below the land is crawling with lizards.

Granite islands like this one have as many as one hundred thousand skinks, some say the highest density of lizards anywhere in the world.

These ground-dwelling reptiles can't fly and they don't swim but they can hitch a ride. Rafting skinks travel on all kinds of flotsam. A log or a tangled mat of vegetation makes a seaworthy craft.

Now ashore in a new land, the first task for a hungry skink is to find a meal. The most tempting delicacies are beyond reach until a coconut delivers a spider hors d'oeuvre. But skinks would never have thrived if they had to depend on such an unreliable menu. A nesting colony with hundreds of thousands of seabirds is a waiting banquet. The skinks would be much scarcer without the seabird colonies.

Noddy terns are another successful island colonist. They spend most of their lives on the wing, but at breeding time they must to return to land. Their sea legs are ill-suited for a narrow perch, and courtship gets off to a wobbly start. The broad branches of the pisonia tree are prime real estate for nesting, and the pisonia's big, floppy leaves are prized for home-building. On a small rocky island with few trees, these leaves are precious and often stolen.

In any case, seafaring noddies don't find nest construction very easy. A combination of shoddy nests and general clumsiness on land leads to accidents. For skinks, this is truly manna from heaven. Even when eggs make it through hatching, the chicks are ill-equipped for life in the trees. Many fall out of the nest before they can fly. And the skinks await eagerly any mishaps.

For the noddies that do survive, their hardships are not over yet. Twice a year the pisonia tree exacts a harsh toll for its services. In return for providing a home and nesting materials, the tree enlists the noddies as seed carriers. The seeds ripen with sticky hooks that attach themselves to passersby. The dangling branches are traps for unwary birds. When caught, some struggle out to sea. Now they become reluctant couriers, helping the pisonia tree to spread its seed to new islands.

Crippled by the load, other noddies are grounded for good. Feathers entangled, they fight for survival. In a final twist of fate the bird carcasses decompose, fertilizing the thin soil in which the trees grow.

Other victims, like this sooty tern, instinctively head for the sea in a desperate attempt to clean themselves. Waterlogged and unable to fly, this unlucky tern's fate is sealed. The casualties attract a nearby army of ghost crabs that patrol the beach. This solitary crab avoids the feeding frenzy and sneaks away with the catch, hiding it in a burrow.

The vast expanse of ocean is no barrier for some intrepid travelers. The day gecko is one such hardy voyager. Occasionally, geckos lay their eggs in driftwood. These makeshift rafts float out to sea, carrying the next generation of geckos into the unknown.

Beneath the waves lurks an underwater giant—the largest fish in the world—the rare whale shark. Up to forty feet long, this leviathan feeds on the tiniest of marine life, plankton. It sucks in large mouthfuls of seawater filtering the plankton out through a sieving system in its gills.

Closer to shore, the hawksbill turtle forages for food in the reef. It breaks apart the coral looking for sponges, and crushes the larger pieces with its hawk-like beak.

Parrotfish also come armed with a bony beak. These large fish must feed constantly during the day. They graze directly on the reef itself. Chipping off fragments of the coral, they feed on the nutritious algae, which covers the reef. These bite marks are the parrotfish's signature. The digested remains come out as a trail of fine white sand.

This coral sand turns out to be a vital ingredient in building new islands around the Seychelles. Sand and coral debris are washed against the reef by storms and tides over thousands of years. Eventually, the sand accumulates on top of the reef to form a brand new island. These small, sandy coral islands barely rise above sea level and lie in stark contrast to the ancient granite fragments of Gondwana. These younger islands begin devoid of life. Everything on them today is a relatively recent arrival.

The durable, waterproof shell of the gecko's eggs protects the precious cargo through the rigors of an ocean journey. Once hatched, the baby doesn't need to feed straight away. The young gecko has a store of yolk inside its stomach, which will keep it going until it reaches the safety of a palm tree. The geckos are tiny and vulnerable, but luckily sandy coral islands have few threatening predators. True masters of island colonization, it would be no surprise to find a gecko on every palm on every tropical island.

The seafaring geckos are joined on these coral islands by countless airborne migrants. More than a million sooty terns land on these beaches at the start of the breeding season. They stay only long enough find a mate and raise their young. It's a risky proposition since they lay their eggs on open ground within easy reach of predators. Fortunately, each pair of sooty terns has just one chick to feed and protect. The birds band together to form a communal nursery.

While there is safety in numbers, the defenders on the fringes of the colony need to be vigilant. A hungry egret stalks the perimeter looking for a wayward chick. The sooty parent jumps to the defense of its chick, despite the intruder's size. One attack is thwarted, but the egret is a persistent foe. Luckily, few egrets stray this far out of the way.

A common sight on most tropical islands, fairy terns are another champion colonizer. These blue-beaked birds are nicknamed "love terns." Unlike the other terns here, these affectionate birds breed year round. They live in the trees as devoted couples rather than congregating in large colonies on the shore. And they often mate for life.

Brooding is a reproductive high wire act. Fairy terns don't bother with nest building. They lay their eggs in almost any nook, no matter how precarious. But when the trade winds start to blow, their balancing act turns into a life and death struggle. The parent has no choice but to hang on.

Strong forces are constantly at work, reshaping and transforming the natural order. Beneath the waves, volcanic eruptions give birth to new mountains, which rise up from the sea floor. They provide a foundation upon which coral reefs grow. Over the centuries, the living reefs build up, layer upon coral layer, and eventually form new islands, which encircle the now extinct volcano. In the center, a shallow lagoon is left behind. This unique process of island formation creates a type of island known as an atoll, and the Seychelles is home to the world's most spectacular.

When Arab traders first came across this coral atoll they called it "Aldabra"—"the Green." Some say that the shallow turquoise waters of the central lagoon reflect in the clouds overhead and create a luminescent glow that can be seen from miles away. Aldabra is the largest raised coral atoll, 20 miles long with a central lagoon big enough to be called a sea. Twice a day the tide rushes in through narrow channels, flooding the lagoon with a fresh supply of seawater. What was once living coral is now fossilized, bleached and battered rock that the tides have sculpted into strange shapes. These low-lying islands have been submerged and exposed many times over their long history.

Among the colonizers of this jagged coral skeleton are some unexpected creatures. This lumbering giant is a rare survivor from the reign of the dinosaurs. Aldabra is home to the largest population of giant tortoises in the world. There are more than 100,000. That's seven times as many as on the Galapagos Islands, the only other surviving population.

Once widespread across the islands of the Indian Ocean, the first giant tortoise to arrive on Aldabra was probably swept off a beach hundreds of miles away. Cold-blooded and naturally buoyant, it can survive at sea for weeks at a time without food or fresh water. It's possible that just one castaway could have been enough to populate the island. Females can store sperm for up to nine months. So a single, fertilized female could have started a dynasty all by herself.

Crab plovers migrate in the hundreds to feed in the lagoon during their wintertime visit to Aldabra.

Over many generations, some birds have become prisoners of the island, like this flightless Aldabran rail. Its ancestors must have flown here once, but with no predators and little competition, the rail has lost the power of flight. Grounded now it can't leave.

Occasionally, the cautious tortoise indulges in a moment of high adventure. One false step and it's over. An overturned tortoise is a dead tortoise.

Lacking teeth, the tortoise swallows its food without chewing.

Tortoise romance can be a tricky business. The underside of the male tortoise's shell has a hollowed out shape to ease the perilous ascent into position. Despite all their hard work, only one in fifty couplings succeed.

When a young hatchling finally emerges, it's in constant danger of being eaten by predators or squashed by a parent. Growing from this...into this...can take a further quarter of a century. But if all goes well, a tortoise may reach as much as 140 years of age.

The short grasses here, known as "tortoise turf," have adapted to the constant grazing. With seeds near the bottom rather than the top of the blade, the grasses have managed to survive.

Tortoises feed during the cool hours of the early morning. By noon, it is tortoise rush hour and they move into high gear. Unable to regulate their own body temperatures, these large reptiles must head for the shade. There is a mid-day jam for cool spots under the trees. With the scorching sun, overheating is their greatest danger.

Apart from finding enough shade and fresh water, tortoises have little to worry about. Finally protected from man, the adults have no predators to disturb their rest. Sleeping with their necks extended is a good way to cool down. As they doze off, a burst of activity begins around them.

Hermit crabs take the opportunity to collect a fresh consignment of tortoise dung. Here nothing goes to waste.

The abbots gecko joins the noon gathering. It hopes to catch one of the insects swarming nearby. Unable to blink, the gecko uses its tongue to clean off its eyes.

Out in the midday sun, it's low tide in the central lagoon. Many come to feed in Aldabra's rich waters that teem with life, including the black-tipped reef shark. The shallow sea makes hunting easy.

Soon the tide turns and the lagoon fills again.

The clean-up crews on Aldabra are the many varieties of crabs that inhabit the island. These robber crabs are scavengers on the lookout for tortoise eggs and hatchlings. The female land crab carries a clutch of eggs on her belly that will soon hatch into larvae. She heads for the ocean to release them in time. Nothing distracts the mother crab from her task.

As night falls, the beach begins to crawl with activity. Robber crabs come in two shades, red or blue, and they can grow up to three feet across.

This giant hermit crab has given up hiding in shells. Besides, there are none large enough for it to inhabit. They are also known as coconut crabs after their favorite food. Powerful claws help them to crack open the hard outer shell of the coconut. Coconut envy can lead to all-out combat.

Undeterred, the female land crab ignores this tournament of jousting giants. She is on a more important assignment. The larvae are now hatching. They need the ocean to move on to their next stage of life. But, for the mother, this can be a hazardous duty. She releases the eggs by lowering one side of her shell and jiggling her body in the waves. This life-giving dance can be risky. Some mother crabs drown in the surf.

The female tortoise lays her eggs at night to keep cool. The digging goes slowly, one leg at a time. It can take up to eight hours of patient work to prepare her nest. The egg chamber is now ready and it is time to lay the eggs. A single female may lay a dozen or more.

It is the start of a new generation that will differ little from its ancestors going back 200 million years. Sheltered by a simple island existence, evolution has left these animals behind. Here, the tortoise has been protected from the march of time.

The islands of the Seychelles remain a world apart, where relics from Gondwana survive in safe seclusion, and where species, separated from their ancestors for generations, grow into new and exotic forms. These islands remain fragile and priceless sanctuaries. It is not the original Garden of Eden, but the Seychelles is a rare living paradise on Earth.

How did the Seychelles wind up a thousand miles out in the Indian Ocean?

NARRATOR: Imagine sharing life with a person who seems to be you. Created from the same fertilized egg, you share exactly the same genes. So profound is their influence, everything about you appears the same: the spaces between your teeth, the way you laugh, your body language. You are, in a word, identical. Or are you?

SUSAN: As infants, they were very much alike. Their physical similarities are obvious. And all their physical milestones happened at the same time. But functioning today, for Jenna and Bridget...they're completely different.

Jenna is enthusiastic, productive. Jenna's going to college. She talks about it all the time now. Bridget is essentially non-verbal. She doesn't have purposeful conversational speech. And there's very unusual behavior. For example, she likes to spit on monitors and then rubs it in. I don't know why, but that's what she does.

How? How could these guys be identical and so, on such a different level, functioning-wise?

NARRATOR: So if genes don't tell the whole story of who we are, then what does?

Scientists suspect the answer lies in a vast chemical network within our cells that controls our genes, turning them on and off.

ANDREW P. FEINBERG (Johns Hopkins University): It's a little bit like the dark matter of the universe. I mean, we know it's there, we know it's terribly important, but we don't really know all that much about how that symphony gets played out.

MARK MEHLER (Albert Einstein College of Medicine): We're in the midst of probably the biggest revolution in biology that is going to forever transform the way we understand genetics, environment, the way the two interact, what causes disease. It's another level of biology, which, for the first time, really, is up to the task of explaining the biological complexity of life.

NARRATOR: Ghost in Your Genes, up next on NOVA.

For each of us, there is a moment of discovery. We understand that all of life is elemental, and as we marvel at element bonding with element, we soon realize that when you add the human element to the equation, everything changes. Suddenly all of chemistry illuminates humanity and all of humanity illuminates chemistry. The human element: nothing is more fundamental, nothing more elemental.

NARRATOR: In the early 1990s, the biggest project ever undertaken in biology captivated the world.

NEWS AUDIO: The Human Genome Project will be seen as the outstanding achievement in the history of mankind.

NARRATOR: The endeavor would reveal the chemical structure of each gene locked within our cells, the blueprint for life itself.

WOLF REIK (The Babraham Institute): The human genome is like a bible where everything was written down. The hope and the expectation was that once we had that book in front of us, and all the letters, we could just read down the pages and we would understand how the body was put together.

NARRATOR: Once the code was deciphered, scientists hoped to find the genetic cause and cure for every disease. They estimated that the human genome, the book of life, would contain around 100,000 genes.

MICHAEL SKINNER (Washington State University): And then when they started sequencing...and it popped down to 60. And then it popped down to 50. And, slowly, it went down to a much smaller number.

NARRATOR: Thirty thousand, twenty-five thousand...as the mapping drew to an end, it appeared that humans had about the same number of genes as fish and mice.

MICHAEL SKINNER: In fact, we found out that the human genome is probably not as complex and doesn't have as many genes as plants do. So that, then, made us really question, "Well, if the genome has less genes in this species versus this species, and we're more complex potentially, what's going on here?"

NARRATOR: So few genes didn't appear enough to explain human complexity. Even more startling, it turned out the same key genes that make a fruitfly, a worm or a mouse also make a human. Chimpanzees share 98.9 percent of our genome. So what accounts for the vast differences between species? Might genes not be the whole story?

Long before the genome was mapped, geneticists, like Marcus Pembrey, had caught hints of this possibility as they encountered baffling genetic conditions—Angelman syndrome, for instance.

MARCUS PEMBREY (University College London): ...named after Harry Angelman, the pediatrician who first described Angelman syndrome. He referred to them as "happy puppet children," because this described, to some extent, the features. They have a rather jerky sort of movement when they're walking. These children have no speech; they are severely incapacitated in terms of learning but are uncharacteristically happy, and they're smiling all the time.

NARRATION: The condition is caused by a genetic defect. A key sequence of DNA is deleted from chromosome 15.

MARCUS PEMBREY: Then we came across a paradox. At the same time, the same change, the same little deletion of chromosome 15, had been clearly associated with a quite different syndrome—much milder in terms of intellectual impairment—the Prader-Willi syndrome.

These children are characterized by being very floppy at birth, but once they started eating properly and so on, they then had an insatiable appetite and would get very, very large.

NARRATOR: Pembrey was stunned. Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, two completely different diseases, were caused by the same genetic abnormality.

MARCUS PEMBREY: So here we're in a bizarre situation really. How could one propose that the same deletion could cause a different syndrome?

NARRATOR: As Pembrey looked at the inheritance pattern for the two conditions, he noticed something even stranger.

MARCUS PEMBREY: What really mattered was the origin of the chromosome 15 that had the deletion. If the deletion was on the chromosome 15 that the child had inherited from father, then you would have Prader-Willi syndrome, whereas if the deletion was inherited from the mother, you had the Angelman syndrome.

NARRATOR: It was a complete surprise that the same missing strip of DNA, depending upon its parental origin, could cause different diseases. It was as if the genes knew where they came from.

MARCUS PEMBREY: You've got a developing fetus manifesting this condition. How does the chromosome 15 know where it came from? There must have been a tag or an imprint placed on that chromosome, during either egg or sperm formation in the previous generation, to say, "Hi, I came from Mother." "I came from Father, and we are functioning differently." So that's the key thing, that although the DNA sequence is the same, the different sets of genes were being silenced depending on whether it came from the mother or from the father.

NARRATOR: It was the first human evidence that something other than genes passed between generations. Something that could control genes directly, switch them on or off. But how exactly did these tags go about silencing a gene?

This odd strain of agouti mice provides a visual clue. Despite the difference in color and size, they're twins, genetically identical. Both, therefore, have a particular gene, called agouti, but in the yellow mouse it's switched on all the time.

RANDY JIRTLE (Duke University Medical Center): As a consequence, it inappropriately blocks a receptor in what's called the satiation center of the brain, which tells mice and us when we're full. So the yellow animals literally eat themselves into obesity, diabetes and cancer.

NARRATOR: So what switched the agouti gene off in the thin mouse? Exercise? Atkins? No, a chemical tag called a methyl molecule. Composed of carbon and hydrogen, it affixes near the agouti gene, shutting it down. Living creatures possess millions of tags like these. Some, like methyl molecules, attach to DNA directly. Other types grab the proteins called histones, around which DNA wraps, and tighten or loosen them to turn genes on or off.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center): And, in simple terms, this contact can be thought of as hugging the DNA. And if these proteins hug the DNA very tightly, then it is hidden from view for the cell. And a gene that is hidden cannot be utilized.

NARRATOR: These tags and others control gene expression through a vast network in the body called the epigenome.

RANDY JIRTLE: Epigenetics literally translates into just meaning above the genome. So if you would think, for example, of the genome as being like a computer, the hardware of a computer, the epigenome would be like the software that tells the computer when to work, how to work, and how much.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: Perhaps the best example of an epigenetic phenomenon...you're actually looking at it. You see, skin and eyes and teeth and hair and organs all have exactly the same DNA. You cannot genetically tell my skin from my eyes or my teeth, yet you couldn't really imagine that these are the same tissues.

NARRATOR: What distinguishes cells is not their genes, but how these genes are switched on or off by epigenetics.

WOLF REIK: And, as development unfolds, certain switches need to be thrown. And you can think of it as a light switch. Switch on the gene, the light is shining, the gene is active... makes the cell do a certain thing. Or the light switch is off, everything is dark. That gene is off.

And as the cells divide, the memory of whether it's a liver cell or a brain cell, that's brought about by these switches. And the switches are incredibly stable.

NARRATOR: But occasionally, some epigenetic switches can be flipped. To turn off the overactive agouti gene, researchers gave pregnant mothers foods rich in vitamins like B-12, or folic acid, from which they could make those methyl tags that silence genes.

The change was small, the effect huge. Fat yellow mothers gave birth to thin brown pups no longer prone to disease.

RANDY JIRTLE: This study, why it is so important is it opened the black box up and told us that this early stage of development—in the womb, basically—is linked to adult disease susceptibilities by, literally, tiny little changes in the epigenome.

NARRATOR: Agouti mice revealed the impact of an epigenetic change, one that occurred without altering a single chemical letter in the agouti gene.

It was increasingly clear that genes needed instructions for what to do, when and where. If the thousands of genes identified by the Human Genome Project symbolized the words in the book of life, it was the epigenome that determined how that book got read.

MARK MEHLER: We thought that by understanding the genetic code, we would understand life, disease, and then we'd all go home and be fine. But, in fact, the human genome project was just the beginning. What it did was it opened us up to this new world, getting us to the point where we're understanding another level of biology which, for the first time, is up to the challenge of the biological complexity of life.

NARRATOR: If the epigenome controls the expression of our genes, could it solve the mystery of identical twins?

These rare individuals are living illustrations of the boundary point between nature and nurture. For, since their DNA is 100 percent the same, any difference should reveal the influence of the outside world.

Most identical twins appear so similar they seem the product of genes alone. Consider Javier and Carlos. Their every gesture seems the same. Or take Ana Mari and Clotilde, who show up in nearly the same red dress when, in fact, neither had a clue what the other was going to wear. They moved through life in symmetry.

CLOTILDE: When I see my sister, I see myself. If she looks good, I think, "I look pretty today." But if she's not wearing makeup, I say, "My god, I look horrible."

NARRATOR: But, five years ago, symmetry appeared to break. Ana Marie was diagnosed with cancer and Clotilde was not.

CLOTILDE: I've been told that I am a high risk for cancer. Damocles' sword hangs over me.

NARRATOR: In fact, it's not unusual for one twin to get a dread disease while the other does not. But how? How can two people so alike, be so different?

Intrigued by the mystery, Spanish geneticist Manel Esteller set out, in 2005, to find the answer to that question.

MANEL ESTELLER (Spanish National Cancer Center): One of the questions of twins is, "If my twin has this disease, I will have the same disease?" And genetics tell us that there is a high risk of developing the same disease. But it's not really sure they are going to have it, because our genes are just part of the story.

NARRATOR: Esteller suspected epigenetics was the rest. To find out, he and his team collected cells from 40 pairs of identical twins, age three to 74.

Then began the meticulous process of dissolving the cells until all that was left were the wispy strands of DNA, the master molecule that contains our genes. Next, researchers amplified fragments of the DNA, revealing both the genes and their epigenetic tags.

Those that had been turned off appear as dark pink marks on the gel. Now, notice what happens when these genes are cut out and overlapped. The epigenetic effects stand out, especially when you contrast the genes of two sets of twins who differ in age.

Here, on the left, is the overlapped DNA of six-year-old Javier and Carlos. The yellow indicates where their genes are functioning identically.

On the right, is the DNA of 66-year-old Ana Mari and Clotilde. In contrast to the younger twins', hardly any yellow shines through. Their genome may be the same, their epigenome clearly is not.

Identical genes active in one twin maybe shut down in the other. Thus, as the years pass, epigenetic changes accumulate in twins, as in the rest of us.

MANEL ESTELLER: One of the main findings of our research is that epigenomes can change in function of what we eat, of what we smoke or what we drink. And this is one of the key differences between epigenetics and genetics.

NARRATOR: But why does the epigenome change, when the genome does not?

In Montreal, scientists Michael Meaney and Moshe Szyf believe the question contains its own answer.

MOSHE SZYF (McGill University): We have this very, very static genome, very hard to change. It could be only changed by really dramatic things like nuclear explosions or, you know, hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. On the other hand, we have the dynamic environment that changes all the time. And so what there is here is an interface between the highly dynamic world around us and the highly static genome that we have. Epigenome is an in-between creature, built in a way, to respond to changes around us.

NARRATOR: Szyf and Meaney believe that experience itself changes the epigenome. To reach this startling conclusion they studied two kinds of rats: those born to nurturing mothers who licked and groomed them intensely after birth, and those born to mothers who took a more paws-off approach.

MICHAEL MEANEY (Douglas Institute/McGill University): What we were particularly interested in is the way in which these animals might respond to stressful events. And we found the offspring of low-licking mothers, during periods of stress, show greater increases in blood pressure and greater increases in stress hormone production.

MOSHE SZYF: They will scream. They will try to bite you. Just walking into their cage, those rats will respond differently.

NARRATOR: To rule out a genetic cause, high-licking mothers were given the babies of low-licking ones and vice versa. Once again, the less-nurtured pups grew up markedly different, and not only on blood tests.

MOSHE SZYF: So the conclusion from that is, it's not the genes that the mother brings into the game. It is the behavior of the mother that has an impact on the offspring years after the mother is already gone. And the basic question was, "How does the rat remember what kind of care it received from its mother, so that it now has better or worse health conditions?"

And we reasoned that there must be some mark in genes that marks that memory.

NARRATOR: But could such a mark, capturing memory, be found? The researchers focused on a gene which lowers the levels of stress hormones in the blood. It's active in a part of the rat's brain called the hippocampus. By extracting and analyzing the gene, they could compare how its activity varied between low- and high-licked rats.

The difference was striking. Less nurtured rats had multiple epigenetic marks silencing the gene.

The result? With the gene less active, stress levels in neglected rats soared. In stark contrast, nurtured rats could better handle stress because they had nothing dimming the genes' activity.

MOSHE SZYF: The maternal behavior essentially sculpted the genome of their babies. We looked at one gene; we know hundreds of genes were changed. But for me, it was a fantastic thing that just a behavior of one subject can change the gene expression in a different subject.

NARRATOR: The most surprising phase of the experiment, however, was yet to come. Szyf and Meaney injected anxious rats with a drug known to remove epigenetic marks.

MOSHE SZYF: And as we injected the drug, the gene turned on. And when it turned on, the entire behavior of the rat changed. It became less anxious. Also, it responded to stress like a normally-reared rat. And we looked at the way that gene was marked in the brain, and we saw that we actually changed the epigenetic marking of that gene.

NARRATOR: Although the work has yet to be replicated, it appears that Szyf and Meaney have linked personality traits, albeit in a rat, to the epigenome.

Could this have implications for humans? We will not know until the completion of a 10-year study, now underway, that will look at children from both nurturing and neglected backgrounds.

But even now, says Meaney, we have clues that our own upbringings produce the same effects.

MICHAEL MEANEY: If you grow up in a family that involves abuse, neglect, harsh and inconsistent discipline, then you are statistically more likely to develop depression, anxiety, drug abuse. And I don't think that surprises anyone. But what is interesting is that you are also more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and obesity. And the stress hormones actively promote the development of these individual diseases.

MOSHE SZYF: So, one day, we'll be able, perhaps, to chart the pathway from child abuse to changes in the way certain genes are epigenetically marked in the brain that unfortunately affect our health years later in life.

NARRATOR: This work is controversial. Still, many scientists now believe that epigenetic changes in gene expression may underlie human diseases.

Take a disorder like M.D.S., cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It's not a diagnosis you would ever want to hear.

SANDRA SHELBY (Medical patient): When I went in, he started patting my hand and he was going, "Your blood work does not look very good at all," and that I had M.D.S. leukemia, and that there was not a cure for it, and, basically, I had six months to live.

NARRATOR: With no viable treatment, Sandra entered a clinical trial experimenting with epigenetic therapy. It was the result of a radical new way of thinking about the causes of diseases like cancer.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: If one has a genetic basis of cancer in mind, then one is simply asking, "What causes genetic damage?" Cigarette smoking, certain types of environmental exposures and radiation causes genetic damage. But, now if I come in and say, "Well, wait a minute, epigenetic damage can also cause cancer," then you've got to ask "Well, why does this come about?"

NARRATOR: The trouble begins, believes Issa, when our stem cells, the master cells that create and replace our tissues, overwork.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: Every time a stem cell has to repair injury, it is aging a little more. And because each time a stem cell divides there is a finite chance of some sort of epigenetic damage, what we find is that in older people there's been an accumulation of these epigenetic events that is easily measurable in DNA.

Now where does the cancer angle come from? Well, if you count age as how many times a stem cell has divided, then cancers, which copy themselves tirelessly, are awfully old tissues.

NARRATOR: As epigenetic errors pile up, the switches that turn genes on and off can go awry, creating havoc within the cell.

ANDREW FEINBERG: There are genes that help to prevent tumors that are normally active that epigenetically become silenced. Those are called tumor suppressor genes. And there are other genes, called oncogenes, that stimulate the growth of tumors. And then the tags, such as the methylation tags, come off those genes, and those genes become activated. So both ways, turning on and turning off, is a way of getting epigenetic disease.

NARRATOR: But could misplaced tags be rearranged? In 2004, Sandra and other patients began taking a drug to remove methyl tags silencing their tumor suppressor genes.

ROY CANTWELL (Medical patient): Your number one thing is, "Okay, is it going work?" And when you know that before this there was nothing, then yeah, it makes you pretty happy that there is a chance to go forward in your life.

NARRATOR: Ironically, the drug, decitabine, was tried in conventional chemotherapy in the 1970s and deemed too toxic. Today, Issa is giving his patients a dose 20 to 30 times lower.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: The idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from killing the cell. Rather, what we are trying to do is diplomacy, trying to change the instructions of the cancer cells, reminding the cell, "Hey, you're a human cell. You shouldn't be behaving this way." And we try to do that by reactivating genes.

SANDRA SHELBY: The results have been incredible. And I didn't have, really, any horrible side effects.

ROY CANTWELL: I am in remission, and going in the plus direction is a whole lot better than the minus direction.

NARRATOR: Roy has not been cured, but he has been cancer-free for two years. And he is not alone.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: Spectacular results—complete disappearance of the disease—can be seen in almost half of the patients that receive this drug. And 20 years ago we wouldn't have dreamed that a drug that affects DNA methylation could have such a profound effect on patients.

NARRATOR: As epigenetic therapy takes off, so do the expectations for this new science. Many believe that a multitude of complex diseases, from Alzheimer's to autism, may have epigenetic triggers.

Consider autism, a mysterious disorder characterized by social withdrawal. This is Bridget. She passes her day running her fingers across her computer screen. Locked in her own world, she has spent the past 13 years drifting apart from her identical twin sister, Jenna.

SUSAN : As infants, they were very much alike. Their physical similarities are obvious. And all their physical milestones happened at the same time. And then, at their first birthday party, we had a big party at the house, lots of balloons, lots of people. And I remember watching Bridget maneuver around the house as if there were nobody there. She was fixated on a balloon, which a lot of babies would be, but something struck me that she was not in tune with everybody that was there.

NARRATOR: Bridget was eventually diagnosed with severe autism. As the girls developed, so did their differences.

SUSAN : Functioning today for Jenna and Bridget...they're completely different. Jenna is enthusiastic, productive, you know? Jenna's going to college, talks about it all the time now. Bridget is essentially non-verbal. She doesn't have purposeful conversational speech, so everything she does say is very memorized because she was taught over and over again.

Do you want grilled cheese?

BRIDGET: Grilled cheese?

SUSAN: Yes or no?

BRIDGET: Yes or no? No.

SUSAN: No?

BRIDGET: Yes, grilled cheese. Yes.

SUSAN: You want grilled cheese, yes?

BRIDGET: Yes.

SUSAN: Good.

There's no prescription that you get when your child's diagnosed with autism.

And new things come that weren't there before, new behaviors that are very problematic, that interfere with her ability to learn anything. So we don't know, really, what the prognosis is.

NARRATOR: And, for a long time, doctors couldn't really help. Despite millions of dollars and years of searching, no single definitive autism gene had been found.

But about a decade ago, scientists at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, in Baltimore, turned their high power imagers on the problem. They scanned the brains of both healthy and autistic children, searching for a biological cause of the disorder. One of the researchers involved was Walter Kaufmann.*

WALTER KAUFMANN (Kennedy Krieger Institute): For a long time, people questioned whether autism was a real entity, because the ways to diagnose autism had been behavior...behavioral abnormalities. And those sometimes are difficult to identify in a consistent and reliable way.

NARRATOR: But, in comparing the brain scans of identical twins discordant for autism, Kaufman finally saw the definitive data he was searching for: an area in the brain linked to learning, memory and emotions—called the hippocampus—was smaller in the twin with severe autism. But how could the same genes create different brain structures? Kaufmann asked Andy Feinberg at Johns Hopkins University.

ANDREW FEINBERG: And suddenly we were able to form an epigenetic hypothesis. And that hypothesis is that they have the same genome, but one of them maybe has an epigenetic change that's leading to a difference in their brain that you don't see in the other twin.

NARRATOR: Kaufmann and Feinberg are now searching for methyl marks in the DNA of identical twins discordant for autism. The work has just begun, but the hope is that by finding identical genes that differ in their expression, some causes of autism may emerge.

WALTER KAUFMANN: We know environmental stimulation, sensory stimulation, auditory, visual stimulation, have an impact on brain development and brain function. And this impact we know now is mediated, at least in part, by epigenetic mechanisms.

ANDREW FEINBERG: Epigenetic changes...generally they stand at the cornerstone between our genome—in other words, all of our genes, the development of the cells of our body—and the environment that we live in.

NARRATOR: So the environment molds our epigenomes. But might it do more?

At the far speculative edge of this new science, some are seeing evidence of an astonishing possibility, that genes may not be all that passes from generation to generation.

The evidence comes from this Swedish village huddled on the Arctic Circle. Overkalix stands out for one reason, its archives.

Olov Bygren, a Swedish public health expert, has been studying them from more than 20 years. What makes these records unique is their detail. They track births and deaths over centuries—and harvests. This is significant because, in years past, Overkalix's location left it particularly vulnerable to crop failures and famines.

LARS OLOV BYGREN (The University of Umeå): In the 19th century this was a very isolated area. They could not have help from outside. As it was so poor, they really had a hard time when there was a famine, and they really had a good, good time when the harvests were good.

NARRATOR: Bygren was studying the connection between poor nutrition and health when he stumbled on something curious.

It appeared that a famine might affect people almost a century later, even if they had never experienced a famine themselves. If so, past and future generations might be linked in ways no one had imagined.

Wondering if epigenetics might explain the phenomenon, Bygren sent his research to geneticist Marcus Pembrey.

MARCUS PEMBREY: I was terribly excited to get this, completely out of the blue. And for the first time it seemed that there was some data that we could then start to explore, so that was the beginning of our collaboration.

NARRATOR: Overkalix offered Pembrey a unique opportunity to see if the events that happened in one generation could affect another decades later.

MARCUS PEMBREY: Olly first reported that the food supply of the ancestors was affecting the longevity or mortality rate of the grandchildren, so I was very excited. I responded immediately.

NARRATOR: Pembrey suspected the incidence of one disease, diabetes, might show that the environment and epigenetics were involved. So Olov trawled the records for any deaths due to diabetes and then looked back to see if there was anything unusual about the diet of their grandparents.

MARCUS PEMBREY: A few months later he emailed me to say that indeed they had shown a strong association between the food supply of the father's father and the chance of diabetes being mentioned on the death certificate of the grandchild.

NARRATOR: In fact, a grandson was four times more likely to die from an illness related to diabetes if his grandfather had plenty of food to eat in late childhood.

This was one of the first indications that an environmental exposure in a man, one that did not cause a genetic mutation, could directly affect his male offspring.

MARCUS PEMBREY: It really did look as if there was some new mechanism transmitting environmental exposure information from one generation to the next.

NARRATOR: Because these ideas were so heretical, Pembrey knew the results could be dismissed as nothing more than a curiosity. To bolster the research, he needed to find out how a trans-generational effect impacted each sex and if it was linked to a specific period of development.

MARCUS PEMBREY: We wanted to tease out when you could trigger, in the ancestor, a trans-generational response.

NARRATOR: So he and Bygren went back to the data. The more they looked, the more patterns started to appear.

MARCUS PEMBREY: We were able to look at the food supply every year, in the grandfather and the grandmother, from the moment they were conceived right through to the age of 20. We found that there are only certain periods in the ancestors' development when they can trigger this trans-generational response. They're what one might call sensitive periods of development.

NARRATOR: They discovered that when a famine was able to trigger an effect was different for the grandmother than the grandfather. The grandmother appeared susceptible while she, herself, was still in the womb, while the grandfather was affected in late childhood.

MARCUS PEMBREY: And the timing of these sensitive periods was telling us that it was tied in with the formation of the eggs and the sperm.

NARRATOR: This suggested what might be happening. Perhaps environmental information was being imprinted on the egg and sperm at the time of their formation.

At last a sharper picture was beginning to emerge. The next step was to compile their findings. Bygren drew up a rough diagram and sent it to Pembrey.

MARCUS PEMBREY: Hand-drawn...this is what Olly sent me, you know he was too excited to wait for the thing to be drawn out properly. You know, he sent me the data, and, in fact, I was recovering from having something done on my heart, so he sent it saying, you know, "I hope this helps you get better quickly," you know? Because it was so exciting.

NARRATOR: When Pembrey looked at the diagram, he was immediately struck by seemingly bizarre connections between gender, diet and health, connections that were most pronounced two generations later. Men, for example, who experienced famine at around age 10, had paternal grandsons who lived much longer than those whose grandfathers experienced plenty. Yet, women who experienced famine while in the womb, had paternal granddaughters who died on average far earlier.

MARCUS PEMBREY: Once I had plotted out the full extent of those results, it was so beautiful and such a clear pattern, I knew then, quite definitely, that we were dealing with a trans-generational response. It was so coherent—and that's important in science, that the effect was coherent in some way—was tying in when eggs and sperm were being formed.

NARRATOR: The diagram showed a significant link between generations, between the diet in one and the life expectancy of another.

OLOV BYGREN: When you think that you have found something important for the understanding of the seasons itself, you can imagine that this is something really special.

MARCUS PEMBREY: This is going to become a famous diagram, I'm convinced about that. I get so excited every time I see it. It's just amazing. Every time I look at it, I find it really exciting. It's fantastic.

NARRATOR: Much about these findings puzzles researchers. Why, for instance, does this effect only appear in the paternal line of inheritance? And why should famine be both harmful and beneficial, depending on the sex and age of the grandparent who experiences it?

Nonetheless, it raises a tantalizing prospect: that the impact of famine can be captured by the genes, in the egg and sperm, and that the memory of this event could be carried forward to affect grandchildren two generations later.

MARCUS PEMBREY: We are changing the view of what inheritance is. You can't, in life, in ordinary development and living, separate out the gene from the environmental effect. They're so intertwined.

NARRATOR: Pembrey and Bygren's work suggests that our grandparents' experiences effect our health. But is the effect epigenetic? With no DNA yet analyzed, Pembrey can only speculate. But in Washington state, Michael Skinner seems to have found compelling additional evidence by triggering a similar effect with commonly used pesticides. Skinner wanted to see how these chemicals would affect pregnant rats and their offspring.

MICHAEL SKINNER: And so I treated the animals, the pregnant mother, with these compounds, and then we started seeing, between six months to a year, a whole host of other diseases that we didn't expect. And this ranged between tumors, such as breast and skin tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease and immune dysfunction.

NARRATOR: He checked that there were no genetic mutations and then proceeded to breed the rats.

MICHAEL SKINNER: The next step was for us to go to the next generation. And the same disease state occurs. So after we did several repeats, and got the third generation showing it and then a fourth generation, we sat back and realized that the phenomenon was real. We started seeing these major diseases occur in approximately 85 percent of all the animals of every single generation.

NARRATOR: His discoveries were a revelation.

MICHAEL SKINNER: We knew that if an individual was exposed to an environmental toxin that they can get a disease state, potentially. The new phenomenon is that environmental toxin no longer affects just the individual exposed but two or three generations down the line.

I knew that epigenetics existed. I knew that it was a controlling factor for DNA activity—whether genes are silenced or not—but to say that epigenetics would have a major role in disease development, so...I had no concept for that. The fact that this could have such a huge impact and could explain a whole host of things we couldn't explain before took a while to actually sink in.

NARRATOR: Further work has revealed changed epigenetic marks in 25 segments of the affected rat's DNA. The implications, if they apply to humans, are sobering.

MICHAEL SKINNER: What this means, then, is what your grandmother was exposed to when she was pregnant could cause a disease in you—even though you've had no exposure—and you're going to pass it on to your great-grandchildren.

NARRATOR: And if a pesticide can generate such effects, what about stress, smoking, drinking? To some, the epigenetic evidence is compelling enough already to warrant a public note of caution.

RANDY JIRTLE: We've got to get people thinking more about what they do. They have a responsibility for their epigenome. Their genome they inherit. But their epigenome, they potentially can alter, and particularly that of their children. And that brings in responsibility, but it also brings in hope. You're not necessarily stuck with this. You can alter this.

NARRATOR: Might our lifestyle choices resonate down the ages, effecting people yet unborn? Such ideas remain, to say the least, controversial. But one thing many in the field can agree upon is the need to take a cue from the Human Genome Project and launch a similar effort, this time to decipher the epigenome.

ANDREW FEINBERG: Mapping the human epigenome is the most important thing that we could do right now, as a big project in science, because it will tell us some very important things about why organisms function the way they do, why cells have the behavior they do.

JEAN-PIERRE ISSA: We now know how many genes we have, but we really don't know how they are regulated inside the cells. And mapping the epigenome will give a much better understanding of this particular process.

NARRATOR: The hurdle is that, unlike the genome, which is the same in every cell, the epigenome varies from tissue to tissue, between individuals and over time.

MARK MEHLER: If you thought sequencing the human genome took years and was difficult, you're talking about levels of complexity that will dwarf anything we knew about the human genome. But it's crucial, it's essential. That's the way that the future is going to unfold. So in a sense, the Human Genome Project was just the beginning.

NARRATOR: The end may be the realization that the code of life is more complex and interactive than we ever imagined.

MARCUS PEMBREY: I've thought of nothing else really for the last five years.

It is said, the first time, you know, one had a photograph of the Earth, you know this sort of delicate thing sailing through the universe, you know, it had a huge effect on the sort of "save-the-planet" type of feeling, you know? I'm sure that's part of why the future generation think in a planetary way, because they've actually seen that picture, you know? And this might be the same. It may get to a point where they realize that you live your life as a sort of guardian of your genome. It seems to me you've got to be careful of it because it's not just you. You can't be selfish because you can't say, "Well I'll smoke," or "I'll do whatever it is because I'm prepared to die early." You're also looking after it for your children and grandchildren. It is changing the way we think about inheritance forever.

ANNOUNCER: Tonight on NOVA, bagging and smuggling exotic birds has become a huge international crime.

DR. THOMAS GOLDSMITH: We see them coming in suitcases, and ridiculous numbers of them are dead.

ANNOUNCER: NOVA goes underground with federal agents in an extraordinary sting operation as they try to expose the masterminds behind this multimillion dollar business.

TONY SILVA: It is competition, it is fierce and greed.

ANNOUNCER: Can the feds stop "The Great Wildlife Heist?"

NOVA is funded by Merck.

NARRATOR: These bird may be the most intelligent descendants of the dinosaurs, and that may be their undoing. Parrots have flourished throughout the tropics and subtropics, more than 300 species of them, in all sizes and every conceivable color. But now they are disappearing from the wild, even as they multiply as pets, an unnatural evolution of wild creatures into collectors' items and commodities.

TONY SILVA: If you have one, you have to have two. You then have to have three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One isn't enough. And this is the obsession that bird people go through.

NARRATOR: How did so many endangered parrots from distant forests find their way into American cages when laws forbid their import? A special breed of cop, a team of wildlife investigators, has been tracking down the answer to that question. They mounted the biggest undercover operation of its kind, a sting called "Operation Renegade." The story of that investigation takes us on a journey across America to Australia, Africa and South America, yet it keeps returning to this unlikely building in Los Angeles and to a young man who knows as much as anyone alive about the victims of the story.

TONY SILVA: There's a mystery about them. They're intelligent, they're inquisitive, they can tax your wits to the limit. There's something mysterious about them, something special that you can't describe.

NARRATOR: The story begins here in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, famous for offering visitors a variety of commerce, legal and otherwise. An American bird dealer had complained to authorities that wild parrots bought here were being smuggled into the U.S., some with contagious diseases. NOVA's concealed camera reveals how easy it is to be a parrot smuggler. All around Tijuana there are wild parrots for sale, cheap.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR: Cuantos?

MEXICAN BIRDSELLER: Forty-five dollars.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR: Forty-five dollars? I want to get them across the border to the U.S. Can you show me how you do that?

NARRATOR: Customers are given smuggling lessons at no extra charge. Simply put the birds in paper bags with some bird seed or maybe a little tequila, the vendors advise, and they'll keep quiet.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR: How are you going to get them across, you know? Yeah?

MEXICAN BIRDSELLER: Put him in the trunk.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR: In the trunk? Make sure he's got a lot of air.

MEXICAN BIRDSELLER: Maybe put a hole in there.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR: Oh, a hole. Okay. Yeah, he might live.

NARRATOR: A parrot in a paper bag in a car trunk is not apt to be discovered by border guards. Nor, in Tijuana's heat, is it likely to make the trip alive. The waste of wildlife and the risk of disease convinced the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to assign several special agents to do something about the smuggling. One of the agents was Rick Leach. NOVA agreed to disguise his appearance and voice. Leach suspected he was getting into something well beyond a local border problem.

RICK LEACH: As it turned out, it involved some of the largest bird importation companies in the U.S., as well as some very complex smuggling schemes that were very difficult to detect, and the illegal activity here encompassed millions of dollars of smuggled birds.

NARRATOR: Agent Leach had 20 years' experience as an undercover investigator in narcotics before he switched to wildlife, but this case would be something new.

RICK LEACH: At the beginning of this investigation I knew almost nothing about parrots. I don't recall ever working a particular investigation that involved parrots in the past.

NARRATOR: With a bird dealer tutoring him, Leach learned that some parrots could be sold for as much as $10,000 apiece in the United States. Why would anyone pay that kind of money for a bird? Bonnie Jay is a portrait photographer. Her models are all parrots. She owns two herself.

BONNIE JAY: I find that the birds are infinitely smarter than dogs and much more companionable. Good girl. I have never loved anything as much as I love the little one. There is nothing on earth that I care about that I have as such a focus, and I think—I, myself think it's strange because she's a little bird. So there is a trust fund in my will, and that will provide for both of them for the balance of their lives to buy lots of toys and to go to the vet. For people who believe in reincarnation, we asked the little one, "What is your story?" and she said that she and I had been together many turns of the wheel as friends and lovers. Who knows?

KATHLEEN HARRING: Hey baby. Hi baby. Alright, come here. How's my pretty boy? Where's mama? No? I bought my first bird in 1980, and I had no children, and I walked into a pet store one day and saw a little blue and gold macaw hand- feeding, and my motherly instinct took over, and they showed me how to hand- feed this little bird, and I brought it home. It was my greatest pet. This bird? I would say it's probably around five weeks old. Scarlet macaw.

NARRATOR: Kathleen Harring has a collection of rare and exotic parrots that's famous in southern Florida. It's also a large breeding operation with about 800 pairs of birds. Although it's a business, sales are secondary.

KATHLEEN HARRING: They're just the sweetest little birds. They talk. They don't—They'll get about a third size, this size bigger. It's amazing. Once you have a wonderful pet like that, and everyone talks about how nice this bird is and the temperament, how you have to have that one. And then you have to have this one. Well, that's what happened, and thirteen years later, here we are with all these birds amongst me. It really is an addicting business.

NARRATOR: As Fish and Wildlife investigators learned, parrots have a very devoted following.

PARROT FANCIER: Paco sing. Paco. Jesus loves me, this I know.

NARRATOR: Several hundred of the faithful attended this conference on the subject in Toronto, Canada.

TONY SILVA: If we run out of time, I'll be here till tomorrow.

NARRATOR: Many came to hear this man, a self- taught prodigy on parrots, Tony Silva.

TONY SILVA: Rather than get into the speech immediately, what I decided to do is I would whet your appetite with some interesting parrots.

NARRATOR: Tony Silva began studying and collecting birds when he was 9. At age 16, he was writing articles about them, and had published his first book before he was 20.

TONY SILVA: My grandmother, who's 87 years old, is a very strong typical Spanish matriarch, and she always said, "You come to earth to contribute something to society. You better watch what you do, you better contribute. You better do something." These are true blue- fronts. They're not the yellow- wing. I wanted to collect. There was this competition in me. I wanted to have them, not so much for the species, but because there was very little known about their breeding. I can make an inroad, I can find something that no one else had found.

NARRATOR: So Silva went off to the jungles of South America to study exotic parrots in the wild. He wrote articles urging bird dealers to avoid buying smuggled parrots, describing cruel methods used to trap and ship them. He discovered new methods of breeding endangered birds. Still in his 20s, Silva was chosen to be the bird curator of a famous animal preserve in the Canary Islands. He became the idol of parrot collectors and breeders all over the world. And yet he recognizes a flaw in bird lovers like himself.

TONY SILVA: It's like when you're a baby and you first try a candy. You need more. People that have to have one pair of everything and they're not satisfied with that, they have to continue and continue and continue. And then once you become a full- fledged breeder then you don't care if they're wild- caught, or if they're aviary- bred, or if they're parent- reared or hand- reared. At that point it doesn't matter. You just have to have more. I've know cases where people have mortgaged their house to buy birds. Where marriages have fallen apart because of the birds, because the birds came first.

NARRATOR: Many of the most coveted birds are parrots known as cockatoos which come from Australia. It has been 40 years since Australia allowed any of its wild birds to be exported. And yet, American breeders and collectors seem to have plenty of them, even endangered species. To find out how this was happening, American wildlife agents went to Australia. In the Australian state of Queensland, mostly unpopulated countryside larger than Texas and California combined, there are only two officers assigned to protect the wildlife. In the even larger state of Western Australia, where many species of endangered cockatoos are making their last stand, the situation is much the same. Farms here have gradually swallowed the bush, leaving only small patches of old trees for the birds. Then the smugglers come, like looters after a disaster.

KINGSLEY MILLER: Given the experience I've got now, knowing when to go and where to go and how to do things, it would be quite easy to get upwards of 15 or 20 of these. Oh, you're a beauty. A little red- tail. He's only a couple of weeks old, if that. Come here, mate. This particular species overseas would command very, very high prices. It's one of the most sought after species. The mother only, generally only lays one egg and only rears the one bird. She'll still sit on him at night.

NARRATOR: Kingsley Miller has spent more than 20 years trying to save endangered birds like this cockatoo.

KINGSLEY MILLER: Next time I come up here you'll want to bite me, won't you? All right.

NARRATOR: Miller is a wildlife officer in Western Australia and has learned to think like the smugglers, to know what they're looking for, and get there ahead of them.

KINGSLEY MILLER: Oh yeah. Still quite young, an empty crop too, so mama hasn't fed him for a while. To get into them, they've actually chopped the hole in, so I can just reach in and pick up the birds inside. Little bits of eggshell indicates that birds have nested in here not long ago. Nothing in here this year.

NARRATOR: In robbing the cockatoo nests, the poachers not only steal a generation of birds, but spoil the nesting places for future generations.

KINGSLEY MILLER: We apprehended two Americans. They were actually in the motion of cutting into one of the red- tail black cockatoo hollows and they were in possession of 34 eggs which consisted of red- tail black cockatoos, long- billed carellas and also gallahs. And there could have been some major eggs in there, but we're not certain. But 34 eggs out of one area, and the damage that they're actually doing to that red- tail nest when we caught them was pretty severe, because that particular tree, no bird is ever going back to that tree.

NARRATOR: This is likely to be the next adventure for a stolen baby cockatoo. Hidden somewhere in the 100 million pieces of luggage that go in and out of Australian airports in a year. Customs officers watching the people, looking for smugglers, rely on tips, instinct and luck. Tony Hanrahan and Mark Bush specialize in catching wildlife smugglers.

MARK BUSH: This is a suitcase that we seized a couple years back now, and it was used to transport live birds. I think, overall, there's about 35 birds inside. Those are PVC pipes you could get at any hardware shop, and what they've done is cut slots in it to allow some ventilation, and they've stuck a carpet piece around it so it doesn't rattle.

TONY HANRAHAN: The mortality rate was quite high, because, as you can see, the bird inside there, there's not much room for them to move around. Normally what they will do is put a stocking around the bird or some sort of tape that confines it, restricts any movement, and eventually the heart rate will just drop, and that's the end of the bird.

NARRATOR: The suitcase full of endangered birds discovered by Australian customs that day belong to this man, Tony Somerville, a highly regarded guide for wildlife photographers. It cost him two years in prison.

TONY SOMERVILLE: By the time they'd got through with me, I'd lost $500,000. I lost my house, I lost a business, the marriage break- up. They virtually crippled me.

NARRATOR: Somerville says that what he was trying to do by smuggling birds out of Australia was save them.

TONY SOMERVILLE: Well, there were a hell of a lot of birds that are endangered, and we're not going to see the results of what's happening now for another 20 or 50 years.

NARRATOR: Like other bird dealers around the world, Somerville claims some species can no longer exist in the wild, and the only way to preserve them is to somehow get them to breeders in other countries, and he says that's what he was doing.

TONY SOMERVILLE: If I thought that I could save certain species by doing it again, I'll have them in a suitcase, send them out tomorrow. I feel that strongly about it.

NARRATOR: Australian investigators, who found a secret room beneath Somerville's home full of smuggling paraphernalia, contend he was not helping birds at all. He was making a lot of money. But wildlife officers like Kingsley Miller admit there's an irony involved in imprisoning people for selling cockatoos and other Australian parrots.

KINGSLEY MILLER: Hello mate. Yes, you're a little beauty, aren't you.

NARRATOR: Although Australian law forbids the export of its birds, Australian farmers are allowed to kill many of them as pests, even some endangered kinds.

KINGSLEY MILLER: What we have here is a young white- tail black cockatoo. These are the birds that are on the endangered list within WA. Just unfortunate, these are also the ones that cause a fair bit of damage.

NARRATOR: Some of the most highly prized birds thrive on farm crops, so Australia has a love- hate relationship with its parrots, and either way, the bird loses.

KINGSLEY MILLER: It may seem ridiculous that these birds are in such numbers, they're being destroyed, it's open season for these birds to be taken. But the law at the moment is that these birds cannot leave Australia. Now, until that law changes, we have to take action against people.

NARRATOR: There are too many travelers with too much luggage to search them all. Most smuggled birds get through and, dead or alive, make their way to airports and pet markets half a world away.

RICK LEACH: We had intelligence information indicating that a lot of birds that were entering the U.S. were probably smuggled.

NARRATOR: Now wildlife agent Rick Leach understood how the birds were getting out of Australia, but he realized it would take more than catching a few individuals with parrots in their suitcases to make a real dent in the illegal bird trade. Leach and his colleagues had something more ambitious in mind. Their plan, Operation Renegade, took them into a warehouse section of south Los Angeles.

RICK LEACH: Well, it's not the best of neighborhoods, and it is in gang territory.

NARRATOR: The federal agents were less interested in catching individual smugglers, the couriers, than in flushing out the people who hired them, the dealers. To do that, they would become part of the smuggling operation. But how? They found the answer to that in one of the small warehouses. It was a quarantine station. Every bird brought into America must spend 30 days in a sealed building like this while it's tested for contagious diseases. The Department of Agriculture regulates the quarantine stations, but private bird dealers actually own many of them. This one happened to be for sale.

RICK LEACH: We purchased a quarantine station from one of the largest bird dealers on the West Coast, a man named Richard Furzer.

NARRATOR: Richard Furzer owns a huge aviary in the hills near Santa Barbara, California. He grew up in Africa, trained himself in the wild to be a naturalist. He became fascinated with birds, and after he moved to America, began to import and sell them.

RICHARD FURZER: The breeding aspect is very hard work, and it's seven days a week and long hours, but I love it, and I think the people that do it love it, and it's not big money.

NARRATOR: In the two years before he met Agent Leach, Furzer had imported more than 280,000 wild birds, mostly finches and canaries, but thousands of costly parrots as well. He specialized in African gray parrots, considered the best talkers of all. His business was perfectly legal as far as anyone knew, legal and, he still insists, beneficial.

RICHARD FURZER: I have a big disagreement with conservationists who think that everything should be left alone in the wild, because I've lived in Africa for 25 years, and the habitat is going a lot faster than the wildlife. I think people don't know how big Africa is, and they don't know what the bird populations are. Any harm I think caused is exaggerated, and also, no one ever counts the pleasure that people have derived from these birds that have been caught in the wild.

NARRATOR: If wasn't pleasure that Furzer had in mind when he talked to Rick Leach a few months after selling him the quarantine station. It was money. Furzer invited Leach to go in with him on a shipment of birds from Africa. Leach recorded the conversation.

RICHARD FURZER: You've got to pay them at the—Because we have to bribe them at the airport in Zaire.

RICK LEACH: You've got to bribe them at the airport in Zaire?

RICHARD FURZER: And in Senegal. And I did it when I was over there when I went to the Ivory Coast. You've got to pay them. They're not allowed to ship them out.

RICK LEACH: Out of Zaire?

RICHARD FURZER: Right. Or into Senegal.

RICK LEACH: Okay. So you pay at the airport. We both had to put up relatively large sums of money to get the shipment in, and as we put together the money, he told me of the smuggling scheme in Africa.

NARRATOR: What Leach had been invited into was a major bird laundering operation. It involved a great number of parrots, parrots smuggled out of African countries that forbid their export and into other African countries that allow it. And from those countries the birds are shipped on to America, everything apparently legal. So even the parrots with official papers were smuggled birds. To help them prove this, the American investigators turned to the bird expert of the Bronx Zoo, Dr. Donald Bruning.

DONALD BRUNING: Senegal has been a major exporter of African grays, even though the species doesn't occur in Senegal. But this is the laundering problem where they're smuggled from one country to another, and then exported as though they came from that country, when they don't even occur in that country.

NARRATOR: By day, Leach and his colleagues tended the hundreds of birds passing through the quarantine station. By night, using a home video camera to document it, they were weighing and measuring the birds to prove by their size their actual country of origin.

RICK LEACH: In effect, we're looking to prove that the birds were smuggled. In this shipment we had approximately 500 African parrots which had been smuggled from the Congo and Zaire into the Ivory Coast prior to shipment into the United States.

JOHN WALSH: Mr. Furzer had gross proceeds of something in the vicinity of $500,000 to $800,000 over a couple of years.

NARRATOR: Assistant U.S. Attorney John Walsh, in Los Angeles, was working closely with agent Leach.

JOHN WALSH: There was shipment, after shipment, after shipment, 400, 500 African gray parrots at a time. All of those birds, or virtually all of those, were brought illegally, originally, out of Zaire.

RICHARD FURZER: I was aware that the birds did not come from the Ivory Coast or Guinea, and to my mind, it didn't make any difference. They don't have border laws in west Africa like we do here, and they don't care where the birds came from, and I really didn't think that it was a crime. I realized that I was lying to the government, telling them the birds came from one country instead of another, but morally, it was fine by me.

JOHN WALSH: It turns out that the volume is gigantic and ongoing. The people are making a lot of money. And, moreover, when you take a country like Zaire or any of the other less developed countries in Africa, we're in a position in the United States of really destroying that wildlife resource.

NARRATOR: The shipments of birds continued to arrive at Leach's quarantine station, headquarters of the sting, and he kept taking pictures.

RICK LEACH: In this particular shipment there were approximately 40 boxes containing several hundred birds. You would have 30 to 40 birds per shipping crate. I would always see a number of dead birds in shipments that came in. Dead birds was an inherent part of the wild bird trade. There's no way around it.

KATHLEEN HARRING: I don't think it's wrong to take them out of the wild because at least here in our facilities, and other people's facilities all over the United States, the birds are alive. Out in the wild there is no more forest left. There is no more place for them to nest. This is what it's all about, working with the rarest of the birds and breed them successfully.

NARRATOR: Kathleen Harring resents the idea that bird dealers like herself are the enemies of wild parrots. Just the opposite, she says.

KATHLEEN HARRING: We're doing better things for the birds than what the natives or the people in those countries are doing. At least they're alive and they're producing.

NARRATOR: But not everyone agrees with her. The Fish and Wildlife Service claims that some endangered parrots are making a comeback in the wild, thanks to new efforts to protect them, and collectors and breeders of wild birds undermine those efforts.

KATHLEEN HARRING: I'd say it's about 10 days old, it's a little hyacinth macaw. You can see the beak already forming.

NARRATOR: Harring argues that, although breeders begin with birds taken from the wild, in the long run, this spares wild birds by supplying the pet trade with parrots born to be pets.

KATHLEEN HARRING: So it's like having lots of grandchildren that you can get rid of them if you don't like them, by selling them. But I like them all, but you have to sell them to maintain and support the habit.

BONNIE JAY: I'm so glad you're here today because I have questions to ask you about things that I thought I had under control, that aren't so under control as I thought.

NARRATOR: Bonnie Jay's white cockatoo has been sneaking out of its cage and eating her photographs. Bonnie has brought in Chris Davis to help her with the problem.

BONNIE JAY: So far she's eaten a full page of transparencies, two felt- tip pens, and the other day she ate my rubber stamp.

CHRIS DAVIS: Right, okay.

NARRATOR: Chris Davis is a parrot shrink. She makes her living advising people how to co- exist with their birds.

CHRIS DAVIS: Because this is a bird who needs to be mentally challenged constantly.

BONNIE JAY: She does. She knows lots of tricks.

CHRIS DAVIS: One of the problems is that Mattie has taken over your apartment, and to her, your whole apartment is her territory. You happen to live with her. Lucky you.

NARRATOR: Davis has a house full of parrots of her own and is convinced they are something more than birds or pets.

CHRIS DAVIS: They'll get the bird, assuming that he's a pet. He's not a pet, he's another individual who shares your home with you, but he has strong ideas of how life should run. Unfortunately, people expect them to be like dogs, or like human children, when in actuality they're more like some sort of melding, as I said, between an alien being and a human child. And as you get into the larger birds you discover they have the intelligence and the emotions of a child, and all of a sudden you're in a real relationship where you have a responsibility to another living creature. Your life is changed by seeing something that appears so alien to us, those of us who are use to fur and hair and things like this, all of a sudden have a creature with a beak and feathers and claws who is more human than some human beings we know.

NAN CRANDALL: Come on, do pretty. Pretty. Yeah, very pretty. Good boy. Okay, now do hi. Hi. That's a good boy.

NARRATOR: Another person who finds parrots irresistible is Nan Crandall. She filled her tiny Los Angeles apartment with them.

NAN CRANDALL: He learned to sing I left my heart in San Francisco, and then he changed the words. African grays do this a lot. He sings, "I lost my boss." And he started to sing, "I lost my boss in San Francisco," and I started laughing, and then he laughed, so now he sings, "I lost my boss, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha." But they're really entertaining and they're a lot of company, you know. And I could make a big joke and say it's better than having a boyfriend around because you don't have to pick up their socks, and if you want them to shut up you just cover them up. This one is Tootie.

NARRATOR: She had the perfect job for a bird lover. It was with the Agriculture Department, tending people's pet birds from other countries as they waited in quarantine for 30 days.

NAN CRANDALL: This is the kind of bird that's a pest in Australia.

NARRATOR: She played music and danced for the caged birds, bought medicine for them with her own money, and sometimes around Christmas, let the pet birds out of quarantine early.

RICK LEACH: This is where Nan Crandall worked. This gate would open up.

NARRATOR: The quarantine station Crandall ran for the government was just a few blocks from the one Rick Leach had bought. They became friends. She knew him as Richard Britton, bird importer.

NAN CRANDALL: Yeah, he was really a nice person. I heard nothing but good things about him. You know, his facility was always clean, his birds were all cared for. You know, he was very pleasant to me, very businesslike.

RICK LEACH: So those quarantine facilities were in this blue building here. There's still a U.S. government sign there. They since closed these down because of the problems that had occurred.

NAN CRANDALL: Come on, Rose. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Poor girl. This has been really hard on my animals. I haven't been able to spend the time with them. See her, she's all dirty.

NARRATOR: Somehow it all went wrong, the job, the obsession with animals, her friendship with Leach.

NAN CRANDALL: I've had her since she was seven months old. Hello?

RICK LEACH: Hello, Nan?

NAN CRANDALL: Yeah?

RICK LEACH: This is Richard.

NAN CRANDALL: Hi, Richard.

RICK LEACH: How are you?

NAN CRANDALL: I'm Okay.

RICK LEACH: What was your good idea, Nan? I'm curious.

NAN CRANDALL: Well, I'll tell you, I don't know how to say it. What if—Let's just...

RICK LEACH: Just tell me.

NAN CRANDALL: Okay. How can we get that black cockatoo out of New Zealand without anybody knowing about it here?

RICK LEACH: Those conversations pertain to a yellow- tail black cockatoo which is a species of cockatoo that's extremely rare outside of Australia. We believe there are probably fewer than 10 such birds in the United States. I mean, are you proposing picking it up and quarantining it or just...

NAN CRANDALL: No, no, no. What I'll do is I'll get it, I'll meet you at the airport, and you'll just take it.

RICK LEACH: So Nan...

NAN CRANDALL: It isn't really legal, but I've done it a lot of times.

RICK LEACH: Oh, it's no problem.

JOHN WALSH: The indictment alleges that Ms. Crandall, in essence, served as the conduit for a lot of the smuggling.

INTERVIEWER: Did you do anything wrong?

NAN CRANDALL: I did things shades of gray. My attorney pointed out—I told him early on that these were things that everyone in my department did, and let's see if I can think of a "for- example." Taking birds as a gift, we'll say.

RICK LEACH: These rainbow lorikeets were seized from Nan Crandall. They were, in fact, gratuities given to her by both U.S. and foreign bird dealers.

NAN CRANDALL: They were just a gift.

NARRATOR: Nan Crandall had befriended smugglers, and the government accused her of helping them. The smugglers gave her some pet birds, but there's no evidence she ever made any money out of it.

NAN CRANDALL: I let that one bird bypass quarantine, but it was not a smuggled bird. I broke a quarantine regulation which was done frequently in the office. I could be fired, I was fired, I got what I had coming to me for what I did. And for what I've gone through for the last year I feel I've certainly paid my dues to society, and I don't feel that it was anything to send me to prison for.

JOHN WALSH: Nan Crandall was a public official. She was employed by the government of the United States. One of the primary facts set forth in the indictment is that she had a public duty. She was not a private person who could simply enjoy a hobby on her own.

NARRATOR: Her hobby, according to the government's charges, had made Nan Crandall part of an international smuggling operation which amounted to a parrot migration gone berserk, parrots laundered or smuggled from Africa, South America and Australia to the United States. The Australian smugglers then returned home with some of the African and South American birds, the parrots becoming more exotic and increasing in value at every stop, or dying along the way.

JOHN WALSH: The result of all this, really, was a lot of money flowing back and forth, and very large profits. We're talking really hundreds of thousands of dollars on each end, and that's really only the amount that the investigation directly uncovered. There's always a possibility there was much larger amounts.

NARRATOR: September 1991, nesting time for cockatoos in Australia. Several American smugglers were known to be there at the time. Australian officers who were now part of Operation Renegade knew every move the smugglers made. Officers Bush and Hanrahan were watching them when they arrived at Sydney airport for the return trip.

TONY HANRAHAN: We picked those particular gentlemen up, and they were taken to an interview room where the clothing was removed.

NARRATOR: The smugglers were becoming more sophisticated, investigators learned. Rather than live birds, they were smuggling eggs.

TONY HANRAHAN: Many reasons for that, lot less mortality rate, the goods are concealed on the body and, therefore, make it more difficult to detect.

NARRATOR: Each man had between 30 and 40 cockatoo eggs hidden in pouches under his shirt. Had they been able to smuggle the birds into America and hatch them, each bird might have sold for several thousand dollars. The American investigators, meanwhile, held off arresting individual smugglers, waiting for bigger game. Their undercover operation had spread east to Florida. They were eager to learn what this man knew. He's a Florida veterinarian named Thomas Goldsmith.

THOMAS GOLDSMITH: There's a tradition in this area, people don't like to be told what to do, and if there's a law saying you can't have it, well, people are going to go out and get it anyway.

NARRATOR: Most bird collectors in the area have been Goldsmith's clients at one time or another.

THOMAS GOLDSMITH: Vitamin A deficiency. Adult female in season. We see them coming in in suitcases here in Miami, or in the holes of boats, and ridiculous numbers of them are dead, suffocated. Baby girl. Just a baby. Everything looks great. Goodnight. If you are caught smuggling drugs, you do hard time. If you are caught smuggling animals, in most cases, they slap you on the wrist, they take away the animals. The worst cases that I've seen, six months, and it's worth the risk. And their profits are substantial. So there's a great impetus.

NARRATOR: But it was one particular case of Goldsmith's that most interested the investigators. It involved some South American parrots named hyacinth macaws, the largest and most spectacular parrot of all, and one of the rarest and most protected.

THOMAS GOLDSMITH: I was working back in the middle '80s for an animal importer.

NARRATOR: Goldsmith says he remembers his client receiving about 35 hyacinth macaws from a supplier based in Chicago.

THOMAS GOLDSMITH: And they all arrived sickly and started to die in droves. Anyone who had that many valuable birds, and these birds are worth a minimum of $8,000 apiece total on the valid market, $8,000 and up, I've seen them go for $13,000, $14,000 apiece, would never be treating them that carelessly. Everything indicated that they were smuggled birds.

NARRATOR: NOVA found Dr. Goldsmith's client in Atlanta federal prison. He is a narcotics smuggler serving a 100- year term. His name is Mario Tabraue, and he says he did, indeed, buy 35 sick parrots.

MARIO TABRAUE: It's very unusual to see more than two or three hyacinth macaws in a shipment. As a matter of fact, it was impossible back in '87 to receive any hyacinth macaws legally.

NARRATOR: Tabraue's drug smuggling financed his collection of rare birds and animals. He readily admits that most of them were probably smuggled, and says those 35 hyacinth macaws were for sure.

MARIO TABRAUE: They were in real bad shape. They had their tails cut off, they had stress feathers showing on them, they were real bony, skinny. The tails were cut off because that's the way to make them more compact for the purpose of travelling in a smuggled way, or a hidden way. They're put in PVC pipes, supposedly, with little holes for them to breath, and keep them in the dark and keep them quiet. They came from Chicago. Tony sent them to me.

NARRATOR: Tony, from Chicago. Tony Silva, the expert's expert. The protector of endangered parrots. Tony Silva a smuggler? The investigators assigned to Operation Renegade had heard the stories about Silva and began to build a case against him. They drew up an affidavit saying they had still another witness, a secret informant who had tape recorded Silva asking him to help smuggle endangered birds from Brazil to the United States. The birds would be placed in plastic tubing inside the door panels of automobiles for the trip across the border at Tijuana, Mexico. According to the affidavit, Silva had said his mother was involved too. Veterinarian Goldsmith says Tony Silva asked him to be his personal vet.

THOMAS GOLDSMITH: He boasted to me that we could bring in any birds that I wanted. He was good friends with the president of Paraguay's—Strossner's daughter. She was involved. She would fly up in her Learjet and bring him these loads of things. At one point I was talking to him I said I had seen a television show about a new kind of monkey that they had discovered in the mountains of northern Peru, and he proudly informed me that he had one.

DONALD BRUNING: I know he has made efforts to buy illegal birds in the Caribbean as long ago as 1980. He approached officials trying to buy illegal birds at the time. There's no reason for the officials to lie about it. Tony insists it wasn't true, but, you know, we have officials from two different countries that he approached and offered to buy them.

NARRATOR: Silva's attorney advised him not to respond to accusations against him, but he did talk about the atmosphere in his esoteric field.

TONY SILVA: It is competition, it is fierce, gossip, and greed. When you reach the top everybody is constantly attacking, and your friends turn on you because you finally made it and they're trying to get up there. How do I feel? I think I've contributed a lot to agriculture. I could sit here and I could list things, one after the other, but, you know, let someone judge me a hundred years from now and see what I've really contributed.

NARRATOR: As Fish and Wildlife agents continued to investigate Tony Silva, they were nearing the end of the undercover operation against other bird dealers. They had watched $6 million worth of wild parrots arrive in America under suspicious circumstances. Finally, on January 16, 1992, officials on both sides of the Pacific sprang the trap.

1st TV CORRESPONDENT: Bird smuggling, it's a multi- million- dollar business.

2nd TV CORRESPONDENT: Officials in Australia, New Zealand and the United States have smashed a major bird- smuggling ring.

3rd TV CORRESPONDENT: The raids follow a three- year investigation involving authorities from three countries.

4th TV CORRESPONDENT: Around 4:00 A.M. the word was through. Within two hours they were charging down bush treks in Lake Rotorua.

JOHN WALSH: This is clearly the largest case the U.S. has engaged in.

4th TV CORRESPONDENT: American agents from the Wildlife Service had that very morning raided 30 premises across the U.S. and had seized more than 300 birds.

NARRATOR: In California they raided Richard Furzer's aviary. They raided the home of Nan Crandall. They raided Tony Silva's home in Chicago and the home of his mother. They raided three of Miami's biggest bird dealerships. One of them was Kathleen Harring's aviary, Love Them Birds. They seized some of her rarest prized birds. Two of those birds would die. Hundreds of birds taken that day were held as evidence in a secret warehouse. Many would stay there for almost two years.

RICHARD FURZER: This sting operation wasn't necessary. If they knew that I was lying about the country of origin all they had to do was prosecute me or tell me, "Don't do it any more," and I would have been prosecuted on one count, or if they had told me not to do it I wouldn't have done it any more. But to spend three years and I don't know how much money, it just seems there's something wrong with the government. I think there's something wrong with the agency, the power they have.

RICK LEACH: This particular investigation, along with other actions that are ongoing, have had a major impact on the take of birds from the wild.

JOHN WALSH: In fact, I think that the big advantage of the undercover operation is not simply to catch the courier who might actually be carrying a particular egg, but the guy who sent the courier, who paid the money, who's making the money on the depletion of the wildlife resource.

RICK LEACH: We anticipate prosecuting 30 to 40 people before we're done.

NARRATOR: Two years after the investigators closed their bogus quarantine station, ending the sting, the case is far from complete. Twenty- nine people in three countries have been convicted of crimes. Several others are under federal indictment in the United States. Tony Silva has still not been charged with any crime. He remains under investigation. The two largest bird importers in Miami also are still under investigation with no indictments yet. No charges have been brought against Kathleen Harring's business, Love Them Birds. She is still furious about the raid and the accusations that she was somehow involved in smuggling.

KATHLEEN HARRING: And you felt like you were raped. Until my dying day, I will fight the government for what they have done to me, if it takes very penny I own.

NARRATOR: Richard Furzer, the California bird dealer who introduced Agent Leach to bird- laundering, plead guilty to smuggling and income tax evasion and has begun serving an 18- month term in prison. Nan Crandall was convicted of smuggling. She was also sentenced to 18 months in prison. She is now appealing that conviction.

DONALD BRUNING: Some of the ones that are more innocent than others may have gotten caught in the sting. It is entirely possible. But hopefully the message gets across that this is not allowed and, hopefully, if there's enough prosecution of these kind of cases that maybe the avicultural community will raise up in arms and say we're not going to deal with anyone who's involved with that, and we're going to try and stop it.

AUCTIONEER: Let's get started here now, and good luck, and remember that a lot of these birds won't be available in the future so get them now and hopefully you can breed them.

NARRATOR: Sometime after Operation Renegade ended, at an auction dock near San Diego, we meet some of the victims, parrots confiscated by the government.

AUCTIONEER: Item number 31 is another African gray. Who will give me $350? Do I hear $350? Three- fifty, who will give me $360?

NARRATOR: Not all of these parrots were the result of the sting. Some had been seized when ordinary people tried to smuggle them into the country.

LEIGH ROTH: Baby, come here. I'm a criminal. I live in Mexico, and one of these birds I really loved, so I brought it back with another bird, and got busted at the airport. So I'm here to reclaim it. All these are caught birds.

AUCTIONEER: One- seventy- five, do I hear $180, $170, $180, do I hear a $185, $180, do I hear $185, $180 once, $180 twice, sold for $180 to bidder number 56.

LEIGH ROTH: Yeah, do you remember me? You had a rough time. You look really bad, but you're going home now. Hi, yeah. You're going home. You're going home, yeah.

NARRATOR: But where is home? Are cages the only future for the wild parrot? Some believe the parrots' long lives disguise the full extent of the damage already done them. The poaching of eggs and young birds for the pet trade may have left some species with mainly old parrots that no longer reproduce. Their flocks may be, in effect, only illusions of species already extinct.

DONALD BRUNING: We're getting the warning sign from the rest of the world that the birds are disappearing. And if we don't do something about it, they'll be gone. We won't be able to see them, none of us will be able to have them, and we will have all lost a very great part of our world heritage with these birds. And it's only a sample, because if the birds go, it probably means the reptiles are going, it means a lot of other things are going too.

NARRATOR: After two years in a government warehouse, the birds of Operation Renegade were now ready for the next phase of their lives.

AUCTIONEER: Sold for $420 to bidder number 10.

NARRATOR: From contraband, to evidence, to commodity.

AUCTIONEER: But again, I want to remind you, all birds are sold as is, where is, so keep that in mind when you bid on this bird.

NARRATOR: For 30 million years these strange creatures have lived free and graced the world with their beauty, only to find themselves now at our mercy, caught between our greed, our obsession, and our good intentions.
