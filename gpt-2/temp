knees and is now a member of the family. The second part of the child's face, also that of the mother, was completely obliterated by the hammer.

The children have yet to figure out what caused the explosion. Dr. Bower says he knows it was a combination of factors: the mother wasn't paying enough attention; the children had no idea what was going on or how to communicate, and that the child's parents had not been able to get to him. All of these factors may be part of why the deaths happened.

ALEXANDRE BOWER: I would guess that the parents of all three of them, the mother, the child, were aware what was happening and were trying to be of assistance, but the child hadn't been able to tell them exactly what was going on.

NARRATOR: By the end of the day, all three of these mothers had been removed from the home. Police suspect that one of them may have been the source. They suspect the others may have been involved. Some of the children tell a similar tale.

GEOFF HUBBARD: I don't think there's any doubt in my mind that they were at the scene of an accident. Now, the reason is, you know, everybody knows that, I mean, everybody's just like, "Oh, they've all been struck by the same lightning strike," so then, you know, you would have to imagine that a great many of them didn't have any other way to communicate, but I think, you know, if they could come forward and be interviewed, they would tell them all about the accident that I'm talking about, the family that is in their house, the children that they had and the deaths that happened to them.

PATRICK ROSE: I just think they were just like any other family, they were kind of like anyone else that had a kid that's younger than two years, and they were pretty scared because they were, they were just...you know, they were in shock. It doesn't help you with a lot of depression that your little girl's got seizures, or your little boy's got cancer, or anything, you know?

NARRATOR: If the children were still alive when the fire started, that's because they were taken to a local hospital, where Dr. Robert Bower's team of specialists performed an autopsy. His results were devastating. Fire researchers are still debating the cause of the blaze. But, according to Dr. Bower, the main cause was a wiring failure inside the house.

For the first few years, fire science was dominated by the theory of an individual's fire.

ALEXANDRE BOWER: If there's no evidence of it being started, you can just dismiss the idea out in the field that there is a human factor. That's not an argument. You know, I think if there is a human being...

NARRATOR: But it's not just that there were no human firemakers around. And it's not just that the evidence of human fire is minimal. When a fire in a house is suspected, the cause of the fire becomes the most important question that must be investigated.

Dr. Bower was already taking on this new field of fire research in the 1930s, when he published his pioneering studies of fire in the Pacific Northwest. These fires were so destructive that a government agency called the Forest Service, which was then trying to contain them, paid thousands of dollars to the people of Washington State. The Forest Service funded its own investigators to study fire hazards in homes.

ALEXANDRE BOWER: We did the tests, and we actually proved that fire is the result of mechanical failure on the house; no question about that. Even though, you know, we were conducting experiments, we actually found this very thing in the house by this very simple investigation.

NARRATOR: This fire, the infamous Northwest Fire, came from a combination of a faulty heating system, bad wiring and other conditions, such as a leaky roof. And it killed seven people as it spread throughout the state.

But what exactly caused this fire?

GEOFF HUBBARD: Our basic idea was that...if we were measuring the fire behavior of a house, we would...you know, we wouldn't notice, for example, that there were sparks from a fire. So we would look, and, you know, what we'd find would be that fire is, you know...and I think if we just looked at a house for fire behavior, we'd find that it's a very, very small fire at the moment - and it's fairly easy to demonstrate that fire behavior, actually, using the instrumentation of the apparatus itself, which has, you know...it's really quite simple. And then it's easy to show that fire behavior, by checking a box that will go
