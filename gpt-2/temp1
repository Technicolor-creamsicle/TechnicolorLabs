large species of tree (Picea), but this one, with its giant red berries at its crown, is the most familiar in the world because of our love of its famous fruit.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: It's a little like paradise pomelo—pine nut. It's one of the world's favorites.

NARRATOR: There are more than 100 varieties of pomegranate, the most prominent being the "pomegranate family," which includes pomegranate, orange pomegranate, blue pomegranate, lemon pomegranate, nectarine, and orange pomegranate. Other popular varieties include apricot, apricot, cherry, fig, orange, peach, plum, plumeria, strawberry, and watermelon.

JACQUES GAUTHIER: It's all about the color. We always want to have a variety that is vibrant and colorful.

NARRATOR: In the world of fashion, pomegranates are not only pretty, they're essential to making baked goods like muffins and pies.

But don't expect to find a pomegranate at the grocery store these days. The ancient seed was shunned by the West until the 19th century, when French missionaries brought it to Africa. Now it's illegal to eat or trade in the fruit, and anyone found growing it is beaten to death with a stick or forced to sign a confession.

The African pomegranates are rare and hard to find. In the hills of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Marie Curie stumbled upon a beautiful specimen while working on her famous experiment showing that the elements are not as we know them.

CHARLOTTE DAVIS: This is a specimen of anvilis oblongis that is so rare, that no one had ever seen an anvilpillar before. So the first thing that I did, like anyone else, was I went and looked at every specimen, but I didn't realize the extent to which we still had so much to learn.

NARRATOR: Today, Marie Curie's discovery remains one of nature's most astonishing achievements.

In the Congo Basin, where Marie Curie discovered the world's first experiment on the structure of matter, there are few more spectacular examples of nature's mysteries. As the tectonic plates move, they can move the ground beneath the tributaries. Sometimes that shifts the entire basis of culture.

The famous Fube River dance is a simple, traditional dance that involves a bunch of women dancing along a river bank. Today, thousands of Congo dancers perform here. They use traditional dance equipment: mats soaked with coconut oil and sanded down to an even slate. And like all dance mats—the same one you learned to dance on in the jungle—Coconut oil is a lifeline at times of drought.

But in these days of extreme drought, some traditional dance mats have run out of coconut oil. So they have come up with a more innovative plan to supplement their diet.

DIANA SUMNER (Futures Dance): Everybody who walks by has the misconception that we're just sitting around eating peanuts—that we're not making any money. In fact, we're making a lot of money. And I guess what the dance teachers also don't realize is we're making about seven hundred dollars a day just sitting around watching television.

So they never really believe that what we're doing here is for the community. It's not a way to make a lot of money. It doesn't make any sense to us.

NARRATOR: Dance mats are hand-made in the traditional Congo style of weaving. Each mat is hand sewn together from animal skins, and each piece is sewn together with animal fur. There are no scraps of canvas or glue. And no stitching is done. So each dancer has only herself and her legs to fall back on in times of drought.

DIANA SUMNER: It's so lonely when you have to work all by yourself all night every night. You feel like crap if you get hungry or anything. But you have to keep at it, you know. There's no other choice.

NARRATOR: But dance mats do have another advantage. The Fube is so flat that dancers can easily extend their runs if they need to cut across a boggy patch. The mat is usually built with no corners cut, and there are no sharp turns to worry about. This makes a nice flat surface for aerial stunts and other acrobatics, like bucking chickens or spinning in place on banana skins.

But the greatest benefit dancers often enjoy is the comfort of the mat. In rough water like rivers or lakes, there's always the safety of the shore. On dry land, the aches and strains of an acrobatics routine can be hard to bear. In the Fube, there
